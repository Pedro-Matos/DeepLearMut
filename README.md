# DeepLearMut
Tese's repository. About deep learning to mutations in text analysis.

Directory's **Cognitive Class** and **TensorFlow-Course** have some examples I have done over this months that can be useful later.

The main directory of the thesis will be **MutList** because the objective is to list the predictions on the mutations encountered.
