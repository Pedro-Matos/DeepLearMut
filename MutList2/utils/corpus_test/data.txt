Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene variants: possible association of the Val158Met variant with opiate addiction in Hispanic women.
A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), G472A, codes for a Val158Met substitution and results in a fourfold down regulation of enzyme activity.
Genotype frequencies of the G472A SNP varied significantly (P = 0.029) among the three main ethnic/cultural groups (Caucasians, Hispanics, and African Americans).
Using a genotype test, we found a trend to point-wise association (P = 0.053) of the G472A SNP in Hispanic subjects with opiate addiction.
Further analysis of G472A genotypes in Hispanic subjects with data stratified by gender identified a point-wise significant (P = 0.049) association of G/A and A/A genotypes with opiate addiction in women, but not men.
All patients were genotyped for rs1799998 (C-344 T), intron 2 conversion, rs4539 (A2718G) within CYP11B2 and rs6410 (G22 5A), rs6387 (A2803G) within CYP11B1.
Specifically, the rs4539 (AA) polymorphism was associated with persistent postoperative hypertension (P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: The rs4539 (AA), H1, H2, and H3 are genetic predictors for postoperative persistence of hypertension for Chinese patients treated by adrenalectomy with APA.
Decreased sensitivity to foscarnet coincided with the appearance of amino acid substitution N495K in DNA polymerase, whereas cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir was due to the L501I substitution.
The rs25531 and the haplotype 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 did not associate with risk of PD.
The C270T polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene is associated with schizophrenia.
COL3A1 2209G>A is a predictor of pelvic organ prolapse.
CONCLUSIONS: The probability of POP was higher in women with COL3A1 2209G>A.
Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene, rs6232 and rs6235, are associated with obesity.
METHODS: We genotyped 1498 German subjects for SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 within PCSK1.
RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies were 25.8% for SNP rs6235 and 6.0% for rs6232.
After adjustment for sex and age, we found no association of SNPs rs6235 and rs6232 with BMI or other weight-related traits (all p >or= 0.07).
The minor allele of SNP rs6232 was additionally associated with 15% higher OGTT-derived and 19% higher clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (pdom <or= 0.0047), 4.5% lower HOMAIR (pdom = 0.02) and 3.5% lower 120-min glucose (pdom = 0.0003) independently of BMI and proinsulin conversion.
SNP rs6235 was not associated with parameters of glucose metabolism.
The Arg753GLn polymorphism of the human toll-like receptor 2 gene in tuberculosis disease.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the Arg753Gln single nucleotide polymorphism of the TLR2 gene in tuberculosis (TB) patients compared to healthy controls.
The Arg753Gln polymorphism of the TLR2 gene was studied in 151 TB patients compared to 116 ethnically and age-matched healthy control subjects.
COS-7 cells transfected with a vector expressing the mutant del-(439-443) NIS failed to concentrate iodide, suggesting that the mutation was the direct cause of the ITD in this patient.
The mutations R243Q, EX6-96A>G, R111X, Y356X, and R413P were the prevalent mutations with relative frequencies of 22.2, 11.1, 8.7, 6.5, and 6.5%, respectively.
Fifteen novel mutations were identified in this study: I38fsX19, IVS4+3G>C, Y154H, R157K, R157I, T200fsX6, Q267H, Q267E, F302fsX39, G346R, S349A, L367L, R400K, IVS12+4A>G, and IVS12+6T>A.
METHODS: We resequenced the positional candidate gene RNASEL in 48 prostate cancer cases and genotyped the previously reported R462Q and D541E polymorphisms in 230 prostate cancer cases and 458 controls.
RESULTS: We found no evidence of association between R462Q and D541E polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in our case/control analysis.
The objective of this study was to analyze MTHFR gene 677C>T polymorphism in infertile male individuals from North India, followed by a meta-analysis on our data and published studies.
Those studies analyzing 677C>T polymorphism in male infertility and presenting all relevant data were included in meta-analysis.
The overall summary estimate (OR) for allele and genotype meta-analysis were 1.304 (p=0.000), 1.310 (p=0.000), respectively, establishing significant association of 677C>T polymorphism with male infertility.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 677C>T substitution associated strongly with male infertility in Indian population.
In family B, we identified a novel homozygous deletion of a G nucleotide at the exon 15-intron 15 boundary, termed 3097delG.
Family C carries a previously reported missense mutation consisting of an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 276 resulting in the mutation N970S in exon 14.
A first Taiwanese Chinese family of type 2B von Willebrand disease with R1306W mutation.
In conclusion, a first report of type 2B VWD in a Taiwanese Chinese family who show R1306W mutation in VWF gene was described..
RESULTS: PBMCs with the heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation had defective T-cell activation.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MDM with the homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation may have an impaired T-cell activation.
A heterozygous single-nucleotide deletion at position 329 (del 329C) was detected in affected individuals from one family, whereas patients from the second family had a nonsynonymous variation, corresponding to C435G.
The most strongly associated SNP with SLE was the rs9271366 (odds ratio, OR = 1.70, p = 5.6   10(-5)) near the HLA-DRB1 gene.
Conditional haplotype analysis revealed three other SNPs, rs204890 (OR = 1.86, p = 1.2   10(-4)), rs2071349 (OR = 1.53, p = 1.0   10(-3)), and rs2844580 (OR = 1.43, p = 1.3   10(-3)), to be associated with SLE independent of the rs9271366 SNP.
Our strongest signal, the rs9271366 SNP, was also associated with higher risk of SLE in a previous Chinese genome-wide association study (GWAS).
RESULTS: We identified seven different heterozygous mutations in seven of the eight investigated patients, including three new single nucleotide deletion/duplication mutations: c.520delC; c.681dupA; c.956delC, three new donor splice site mutations: c.360+1G>C; c.899+1G>T; c.1570+2T>C, as well as a previously described nonsense mutation: p.Arg153X.
RT-PCR analysis in the mildest affected patient with a heterozygous c.360+1G>C mutation, demonstrated expression of a short in-frame mutant transcript with exon 5 skipping, which may account for the mild phenotype.
MTHFR C677T polymorphism in the 3 groups was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism studies.
An insertion, 2590_2591insCCCC in exon 8 and a deletion, 752_758delGCCGGCC, in exon 3 will both result in frameshifts.

RESULTS: By using homozygosity linkage analysis we have mapped the family on chromosome 3q27.3 with a two point LOD score of 4.04, Mutation screening of the LIPH gene revealed a homozygous c.659_660delTA deletion mutation segregating with the disease phenotype.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the c.659_660delTA mutation in the LIPH gene cause autosomal recessive WH/hypotrichosis phenotype in this family.
Two novel mutations, L490R and V561X, of the transferrin receptor 2 gene in Japanese patients with hemochromatosis.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The low prevalence of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in Japan means that the genetic background of hemochromatosis in Japanese patients remains unclear.
In the TfR2 gene, 2 novel mutations, 1469T->G (L490R) and 1665delC (V561X), were found in 2 patients.
A known variation, 714C-> (I238M), was also found in the patient with L490R.
The patient homozygous for both L490R and I238M presented with a mild manifestation of hemochromatosis at the age of 41 years.
The patient homozygous for V561X had severe iron overload with the triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation at the age of 58 years.
Deletion polymorphisms in the genes GSTM1 and GSTT1 and a base transition polymorphism at codon 105 (Ile-->Val) in GSTP1 were investigated  in relation to breast cancer risk.
These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence for association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96]), which is located in the plasmacytoma variant translocation gene PVT1.
We subsequently genotyped these 11 variants and an additional 87 SNPs identified through public databases in 319-kb flanking rs2720709 ( approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with ESRD at P < 0.01.
The strongest evidence for association was found for rs2648875 (P = 0.0000018; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which maps to intron 8 of PVT1.
In boys with low erythrocyte PhK activity (i.e., x-linked liver glycogenosis [XLG] type I), deletion of exon 2 (splice site mutation of 79-1 G > T) or nonsense mutation of Q1169X or R497X was identified.
However, missense mutation of R295C was identified in one boy with normal erythrocyte PhK activity (i.e., XLG type II).
To understand why the c.671G>A causes exons 6 and 7 skipping, nuclear RNA was separated from cytoplasmic RNA and both were analyzed by RT-PCR.
The accumulation of A68P mutated precursor might have a cytotoxicity effect, leading to a gradual death of magnocellular neurones, and a progressive decline in AVP secretion..
The missense mutations included the amino acid substitution p.E180K, p.R194S, and p.C152G.
The frameshift mutations are caused by insertions resulting in the creation of stop codons: p.D157fsX158 and p.S173fsX174, which could code for truncated LDLR of 157 and 173 amino acids, respectively.
The mutation (c.334C-->G) introduced a  splice donor site within exon 5 that caused the expression of an aberrant transcript lacking 159 nucleotides corresponding to codons 112-164.
DNA samples from 59 humans without fatty liver and from 28 humans with NAFLD were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 8 of PEMT, which leads to a V175M substitution.
V175M is a loss of function mutation, as determined by transiently transfecting McArdle-RH7777 cells with constructs of wild-type PEMT open reading frame or the V175M mutant.
Interestingly, the major allele for rs16754 single nucleotide polymorphism was G (25-homozygous and 6-heterozygous) which was in contrast to A in the Western reports.
The frequency of WT1 mutation in the Southeast Asian AML was thus comparable to the figures reported from the West although the designated major allele for rs16754 polymorphism was different..
One breast cancer sample also contained a G --> T transversion (Q253H).
We performed a case-control study to test the association between two polymorphisms in the hMSH2 gene: an A --> G transition at 127 position producing an Asn --> Ser substitution at codon 127 (the Asn127Ser polymorphism) and a G --> A transition at 1032 position resulting in a Gly --> Asp change at codon 322 (the Gly322Asp polymorphism) and breast cancer risk and cancer progression.
A strong association between breast cancer occurrence and the Gly/Gly phenotype of the Gly322Asp polymorphism (odds ratio 8.39; 95% confidence interval 1.44-48.8) was found.
Therefore, MMR may play a role in the breast carcinogenesis and the Gly322Asp polymorphism of the hMSH2 gene may be considered as a potential marker in breast cancer..
A unique correlation between a single TP53 mutation (R337H) and ACT has been reported in southern Brazilian children.
In this study, we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of the hERG splice site mutation 2398+1G>C and the genotype-phenotype relationship of mutation carriers in three unrelated kindreds with long QT syndrome.
The effect of 2398+1G>C on mRNA splicing was studied by analysis of RNA isolated from lymphocytes of index patients and using minigenes expressed in HEK293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that the 2398+1G>C mutation disrupted the normal splicing and activated a cryptic splice donor site in intron 9, leading to the inclusion of 54 nt of the intron 9 sequence in hERG mRNA.
Our results demonstrate that 2398+1G>C activates a cryptic site and generates a full-length hERG protein with an insertion of 18 amino acids, which leads to a trafficking defect of the mutant channel..
A new but frequent mutation of apoB-100-apoB His3543Tyr.
Familial defective apolipoproteinB 100 (FDB) is caused by a R3500Q mutation of the apoB gene and results in decreased binding of LDL to the LDL-receptor.
Apart from this, three other apoB mutations, R3500W, R3531C and R3480W, affecting binding to the LDL-receptor are known to date.
The mutation, CAC(3543)TAC results in a His3543Tyr substitution in apoB-100 (H3543Y).
The prevalence of heterozygotes for H3543Y in the study population was 0.47% compared to 0.12% for the known Arg 3500 Gln (R3500Q) mutation.
In two unrelated pedigrees of Alpers' syndrome, each affected child was found to carry a homozygous mutation in exon 17 of the POLG locus that led to a Glu873Stop mutation just upstream of the polymerase domain of the protein.
In addition, each affected child was heterozygous for the G1681A mutation in exon 7 that led to an Ala467Thr substitution in POLG, within the linker region of the protein..
The Kna/b DNA polymorphism was identified as a V1561M mutation with allele frequencies of Kna (V1561) 0.9 and Knb (M1561) 0.1.
As in smaller previous studies, p.A150P (65%), p.A175D (11%) and p.N335K (8%) were the most common mutated alleles, followed by c.360_363delCAAA, p.R60X, p.Y204X, and c.865delC.
Eight novel mutations were identified in eight families with HFI: a small indel mutation (c.1044_1049delTTCTGGinsACACT), two small deletions (c.345_372del28; c.841_842delAC), two splice site mutations (c.113-1G>A, c.799+2T>A), one nonsense mutation (c.612T>G (p.Y204X)), and two missense mutations (c.532T>C (p.C178R), c.851T>C (p.L284P)).
We hypothesised that the G-395A polymorphism in the promoter region of the human Klotho gene may contribute to the prevalence of Essential Hypertension (EH).
METHODS: We investigate whether the G-395A polymorphism of Klotho is associated with EH in a population consisting of 215 patients with EH and 220 non-hypertensive subjects.
We also tested whether a G/A substitution at the G-395A site affected the transcription level in vitro through the dual-luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: Differences in the genotype distributions of the G-395A polymorphism between the EH and non-hypertension groups are statistically significant (P=0.032).
There are differential effects of age, gender and smoking status on the association of the G-395A polymorphism with EH; the G-395A polymorphism is significantly associated with EH in subjects over 60years old, in females and in nonsmokers.
The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that the -395A carrier of a 498-bp DNA fragment (containing the G-395A site) upstream of the Klotho gene has higher relative luciferase activity than the -395G carrier.
CONCLUSIONS: The G-395A polymorphism of the human Klotho gene is associated with EH and may be a potential regulatory site..
We also detected the previously reported A182T and nine novel polymorphisms in the patients.
Mutations V330M and 1009delA occurred on different alleles in one individual, and we suggest that these mutations cause cystinuria in this patient.
The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and the A1166C polymorphism of the AT(1)R gene was additionally assessed by DdeI digestion.
Card15 and Crohn's disease: healthy homozygous carriers of the 3020insC frameshift mutation.
Genomic DNA was isolated from venous blood of all participants to determine the CARD15 3020insC mutation by using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Association with CARD15 3020insC was statistically significant for CD, but not for UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Although CARD15 3020insC appears to be etiologically important in CD, homozygous carriage does not always lead to IBD..
RESULTS: A significant association of the rs729302 A allele with RA susceptibility was found in both sets (odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.35, p<0.001 in the combined analysis).
When the patients were stratified by the SE, the rs729302 A allele was found to confer increased risk to RA in patients that were SE negative (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92, p = 0.001) as compared with patients carrying the SE (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33, p = 0.24).
In both sets, no genotyped polymorphisms were significantly associated with RA susceptibility, but rs729302 was significantly associated.
A total of 2461 subjects (normotensive = 611; hypertensive = 1850) were selected and genotyped for the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D), angiotensinogen (AGT) T/C704, angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) A/C1166 and aldosterone synthase (ALDO) T/C-344 genetic variants.
When comparing allele and genotype distributions in normotensives and hypertensives, the latter presented a small but statistically significant increase of the C allele of AGT T/C704, the A allele of AT1 A/C1166 and the T allele of ALDO T/C-344 polymorphisms (P = 0.018, P = 0.037 and P = 0.015, respectively), with similar trends all over the country.
A step-wise logistic regression analysis confirmed these findings, by entering in the model as independent predictors of blood pressure status of AGT T/C704 (P = 0.013), ALDO T/C-344 (P = 0.032) and AT1 A/C1166 polymorphisms (P = 0.075), but not ACE I/D (P = 0.996).
46 unrelated families, each including at least two pancreatitis patients and carrying neither cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) mutations nor the frequent SPINK1 N34S mutation, participated in this study.
In one family, c.27delC showed segregation with the disease across two generations, with a penetrance of up to 75%.
In addition, a novel heterozygous splicing mutation, c.87+1G>A (G>A substitution at nucleotide +1 of intron 2) was found in one family with familial pancreatitis.
Sequencing TACSTD2 revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation c.356G>A, leading to amino acid substitution C119Y in the two affected siblings.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel TACSTD2 C119Y mutation leading to an amino acid substitution was identified in two affected siblings of a family.
Although a single missense variant (L546V) appeared to act as a modest predictor of risk, the remaining variants were no more common in breast cancer cases as compared with controls..
An involvement of M235T polymorphism of the AGT gene in renal disease was observed in our study.
In the A1166C AT1R polymorphism the homozygous CC genotype was also more frequent in interstitial nephritis patients (7% vs.
The C allele of the A1166C polymorphism appears to be a risk factor for faster disease progression..
The four new base substitutions we identified were 1849T>A, 2122C>T, 2180C>T, and 2192C>T.
The three newly identified STRs were 1978(TATC)(1-2), 2193(ATCT)(5-13), and 2234(TGTA)(5-7).
The Arg792Gly substitution is located at the Y-position of Gly-X-Y triplet, and it is likely that this substitution decreased the thermal stability of the triple helix and may affect fibril growth by replacement of an arginine residue, which is important for a conformation of the triple helix..
The c.130G>A transition was predicted to result in a non-conservative substitution of valine-to-methionine at codon 44 (p.V44M) with damaging effects on protein function.
We progressively screened DNA samples from 613 individuals with ID initially for the most frequent ARX mutations (c.304ins(GCG)(7)'expansion' of pA1 and c.429_452dup 'dup24bp' of pA2).
Overall, eight families with six mutations in ARX were identified (1.31%): five duplication mutations in pA2 (0.82%) with three new clinical reports of families with the dup24bp and two duplications larger than the dup24bp mutation discovered (dup27bp, dup33bp); and three point mutations (0.6%), including one novel mutation in the homeodomain (c.1074G>T).
Molecular analysis of the LKB1 gene in a simplex case of PJS revealed a substitution of cytosine (C) for guanine (G) at codon 246 in exon 6, resulting in the Tyr246X mutation.
The presence of the D401H mutation may predispose subjects to obesity, hypertension, and other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome..
Carrier frequency of mutation 657del5 in the NBS1 gene in a population of Polish pediatric patients with sporadic lymphoid malignancies.
In addition, the substitution 643C>T (R215W) has also been found in excess among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
The NBS1 mutation 657del5 on one allele was found in 3 of 270 patients with ALL and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carrier was found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).
No carriers of the variant R215W were detected in any studied group.
The relative frequency of the 657del5 mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by place of patient residence, of whom 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006).
In the analyzed population with malignancies, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of mutation 657del5 was found in comparison with the control Polish population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65).
Six mutations were found to be significantly more common in the former group than in the latter: G529A (3/4 vs.
0/5), C934A (4/4 vs.
1/5), A1053G (4/4 vs.
1/5), G1915T/A (4/4 vs.
0/5), T2005C/A (4/4 vs.
0/5), and C3026T (3/4 vs.
The dopamine b-hydroxylase -1021C/T polymorphism is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in the Epistasis Project.
Although the position of the mutation 5504delA PTC was located upstream of the previous mutations reported in combination with the 6573 + 1G > C mutation, the two mutations together give an apparently milder clinical phenotype.
We investigated the association between chronic ITP and the frequency of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs763780 (7488T/C), which causes a His-to-Arg substitution at amino acid 161.
RESULTS: A novel heterozygous c.3703T>C change in exon 29 of FBN1 was detected in the proband, which resulted in the substitution of serine by proline at codon 1235 (p.S1235P).
CONCLUSIONS: We indentified a novel p.S1235P mutation in FBN1, which is the causative mutation for MFS in this family.
Compound heterozygosity for a novel nine-nucleotide deletion and the Asn45Ser missense mutation in the glycoprotein IX gene in a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome.
Her mother was heterozygous for the Asn45Ser mutation, and her father, for the nine-nucleotide deletion.
A Taiwanese boy with congenital generalized lipodystrophy caused by homozygous Ile262fs mutation in the BSCL2 gene.
He had a homozygous insertion of a nucleotide, 783insG (Ile262fs mutation), in exon 7 of the BSCL2 gene.
These patients and controls were also genotyped for the rs4112788 single nucleotide polymorphism, in strong linkage disequilibrium with the LCE3C_B cluster.
RESULTS: Allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and controls for the rs4112788 and LCE3C_LCE3B-del polymorphisms.
A novel missense mutation Asp506Gly in Exon 13 of the F11 gene in an asymptomatic Korean woman with mild factor XI deficiency.
To the best of our knowledge, the Asp506Gly is a novel missense mutation, and this is the first genetically confirmed case of mild FXI deficiency in Korea..
A novel missense c.686C>G mutation, which causes the substitution of a conserved arginine at amino acid position 229 by glycine (p.R229G) in exon 8 of the FRMD7 gene, was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel p.R229G mutation in the FRMD7 gene causes the NYS phenotype, and skewed X inactivation influences the manifestation of the disease in X linked NYS females..
Markers rs2073163 and rs1155794 from haploblock 2 were associated with 2-hour plasma glucose levels in men during the 3-year follow-up.
The same two markers together with rs2073162 associated with the conversion of IGT to T2D in men.
RESULTS: Direct sequencing of the encoding regions of the candidate genes revealed a heterozygous mutation c.592C-->T in exon 2 of the gap junction protein, alpha 8 (GJA8) gene.
CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first to relate p.R198W mutation in GJA8 with CCMC.
Mutational analysis for the WRN gene revealed a homozygous nucleotide substitution 3190C>T in exon 24, resulting in a protein product with replacement of an arginine residue at position 573 by termination codon (Arg987Ter).
A WS patient with an Arg987Ter mutation has been previously reported in Switzerland, the present case is the first to be identified in Asia.
All nine patients were homozygous and their parents heterozygous for a novel, translationally silent GLDC exon 22 transversion c.2607C>A.
Homozygosity for c.2607C>A was also identified in an unrelated but haplotypically identical patient with an unusually favorable outcome despite severe neonatal-onset GE.
The single nucleotide substitution I280S (1123T-->G) was present either on both alleles or in a hemizygous form with complete deletion of the second allele.
The I280S mutation was recently reported in a heterozygous patient.
The severe phenotype with seriously impaired intellectual development, hyperkinetic behaviour, tachycardia, hearing and visual impairment is probably due to the dominant negative effect of the I280S mutant protein and the absence of any functional TR-beta..
To investigate the GSTP1 Ile105Val genotype frequency in prostate cancer cases in the Kashmiri population, we designed a case-control study, in which 50 prostate cancer cases and 45 benign prostate hyperplasia cases were studied for GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism, compared to 80 controls taken from the general population, employing the PCR-RFLP technique.
We found the frequency of the three different genotypes of GSTP1 Ile105Val in our ethnic Kashmir population, i.e., Ile/Ile, Ile/Val and Val/Val, to be 52.4, 33.3 and 14.3% among prostate cancer cases, 48.5, 37.5 and 14% among benign prostate hyperplasia cases and 73.8, 21.3 and 5% in the control population, respectively.
The missense mutation Ser49Cys (c.146C>G, p.S49C), carried by approximately 2% of subjects, was more common in cases than controls in both study populations, combined odds ratio (OR) 1.69 (95% CI, 1.19-2.40; P=0.004).
Another missense mutation at approximately 2% frequency, Phe858Leu (c.2572T>C, p.F858L), was associated with a significant increased risk in the U.S.
A gain-of-function mutation resulting in the S810L amino acid substitution in the hormone-binding domain of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR, locus symbol NR3C2) is responsible for early-onset hypertension that is exacerbated in pregnancy.
Here, we screened 942 Japanese patients with hypertension for the S810L mutation in exon 6 in the MR.
We did not identify the S810L mutation in our hypertensive population, indicating that S810L does not play a major role in the etiology of essential hypertension in Japanese.
The F826Y mutation is present in the MR hormone-binding domain and might affect the ligand affinity.
The F826Y mutation was also identified in 13 individuals (5 hypertensives and 8 normotensives) in a Japanese general population (n=3,655).
The frequencies of the F826Y mutation in the hypertensive population (3/942) and in the hypertensive group (5/ 1,480) and the normotensive group (8/2,175) in the general population were not significantly different, suggesting that this mutation does not greatly affect hypertension.
Although it is unclear at present whether or not the F826Y mutation makes a substantial contribution to the mineralocorticoid receptor activity, this missense mutation may contribute, to some extent, to clinical phenotypes through its effects on MR..
Sequence analysis of aggrecan complementary DNA from an affected individual revealed homozygosity for a missense mutation (c.6799G --> A) that predicts a p.D2267N amino acid substitution in the C-type lectin domain within the G3 domain of aggrecan.
This phenotype exacerbated over time, cosegregates with the first heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] reported to date for the GR, replacing an arginine (CGA) by a stop (TGA) at amino-acid 469 in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor.
Sequencing of the PAX6gene, three intragenic mutations including a novel heterozygous splicing-site mutations c.357-3C>G (p.Ser119fsX) were identified in the patients of the AN group.
A novel missense mutation c.643T>C (p.S216P) was detected in the anterior segment malformation group.
The mutation p.S216P located in the homeodomain region of the PAX6 caused the phenotype of Peters anomaly in family A6 with different expressing.
Additionally, we identified one intronic mutation outside the consensus splice sites (c.2838+5G > A) and 21 nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid change (including three previously described mutations: p.T269M, p.R461Q, p.G771R), the pathogenicity of which should be confirmed by expression studies (p.S132W, p.Y138F, p.G171A, p.T187K, p.R212K, p.T269M, p.R373W, p.I440N, p.R461Q, p.N533Y, p.C644F, p.H651R, p.V705M, p.N732K, p.G771R, p.H775R, p.T830M, p.A841P, p.D880V, p.S957P and p.R966G).
Mutation analysis allowed us to identify sequence alterations in both alleles for 19 patients and in one allele for 7 patients One patient was carrying three mutations (p.Y138F, p.T269M and p.E153X) and one patient was carrying two amino acid substitutions on the same allele (p.V705M and p.R212K) and an unidentified mutation on the other allele.
The frameshift caused by the c.1052delA deletion removes the last 81 amino acids of the protein, including the third zinc-finger motif.
Single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous C139T transition in PAX9 in the affected members of the family.
The C139T mutation, predicted to result in the substitution of an arginine by a tryptophan (R47W) in the N-terminal subdomain, affected conserved residues in the PAX9 paired domain.
The R47W mutation dramatically reduced DNA binding suggesting that the mutant protein with consequent haploinsufficiency results in a clinical phenotype..
As a result, the 1,3 allele has -218G and -189T complying with the reference database sequence, the 2,4 allele has -218G and T-189C substitution and the allele 1,2,3,4 genotype has substitutions at positions G-218C and T-189C.
In this study, we have identified two novel somatic CHEK2 mutations, c.349A > G (p.R117G) and c.967A > C (p.E321K), in prostate tumor specimens and investigated the functions of these mutants in vivo.
We have shown that most of the germline CHEK2 mutations and one somatic mutation (p.R117G) within FHA domain have modestly reduced CHEK2 kinase activity in comparison with wild-type CHEK2 while the other somatic mutation (p.E321K) within the kinase domain of CHEK2 totally abolished CHEK2 kinase activity.
In one female patient a p.F366L amino acid polymorphism was found heterozygous, which could not be displayed in controls.
Five of them [c.185C>T (Thr60Met), c.1712C>T (Ala569Val), c.1930C>T (Arg642Cys), c.2552T>A (Leu849His) and c.1932delC] have been reported in Japanese patients, but not in GS patients from other ethnic groups.
The remaining four mutations [c.7A>T (Met1Leu), c.1181_1186+20del26, c.1811_1812delAT and IVS16+1G>A] were novel.
We identified a novel heterozygous single-nucleotide substitution 10G>A (Glu 4 Lys) in the first exon of the leukotriene C4 synthase gene (LTC4S).
RT-PCR analysis of the c.610-2A>G transition demonstrated that the change altered splicing, leading to the production of two distinct aberrantly spliced forms, viz.
To determine whether c.609+28_610-16del allele-derived transcripts were subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), patient fibroblasts were incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin.
Quantitative real-time PCR and GNPTG western blot analysis confirmed that the homozygous microdeletion p.G204VfsX17 had elicited NMD resulting in failure to synthesize GNPTG protein.
Ectopic expression of mutant forms of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) lacking lipid (G129E) or lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase activity decreased sensitivity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which have wild-type PTEN, to doxorubicin and increased sensitivity to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin.
Cells transfected with a mutant PTEN gene lacking both lipid and protein phosphatase activities were more resistant to doxorubicin than cells transfected with the PTEN mutant lacking lipid phosphatase activity indicating that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN was also important in controlling the sensitivity to doxorubicin, while no difference was observed between the lipid (G129E) and lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase PTEN mutants in terms of sensitivity to rapamycin.
Molecular analysis revealed intact alpha-globin genes and a heterozygosity for a GTT-->GCT transition at codon 23 of the beta-globin gene, causing a Val-->Ala amino acid substitution.
METHOD: DNAs were extracted from 31 plasma samples from 31 patients and analyzed by both methods for EGFR Exon 19 deletion and EGFR L858R mutation.
By mass spectrometry genotyping, the plasma samples contained mutant DNA corresponding to 5/14 EGFR Exon 19 deletions and 3/4 EGFR L858R mutations previously diagnosed in the matched tumors.
GPX4 rs713041 is located near the selenocysteine insertion sequence element in the GPX4 3' untranslated region, and the rare allele of this SNP is associated with an increased risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 1.27 per rare allele carried (95% CI, 1.13 to 11.43).
RESULTS: Three pathogenic mutations were identified; two mutations, S482X and K386T, were novel and found in three patients.
One sporadic BCC presented the mutation g.2885G>C in exon 17 of PTCH1, which predicts the substitution p.R962T in an external domain of the protein.
In addition, the leukocytes and tumor cells of one patient with Gorlin syndrome showed the mutation g.2839T>G in the same exon and gene, which predicts a p.E947stop and truncated protein.
Variants of coagulation factors [factor V 1691G>A (factor V Leiden), factor V 4070A>G (factor V HR2 haplotype), factor VII Arg353Gln, factor XIII Val34Leu, beta-fibrinogen -455G>A, prothrombin 20210G>A], coagulation inhibitors [tissue factor pathway inhibitor 536C>T, thrombomodulin 127G>A], fibrinolytic factors [angiotensin converting enzyme intron 16 insertion/deletion, factor VII-activating protease 1601G>A (FSAP Marburg I), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-675 insertion/deletion (5G/4G), tissue plasminogen activator intron h deletion/insertion], and other factors implicated in influencing susceptibility to thromboembolic diseases [apolipoprotein E2/E3/E4, glycoprotein Ia 807C>T, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C>T] were included.
The distribution of glycoprotein Ia 807C>T deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and a comparison with previously published data indicates marked region and ethnicity dependent differences in the genotype distributions of some other factors..
Nominal association with the disorder was observed for rs2236624-CC, and phenotypic variability in ASD symptoms was influenced by rs3761422, rs5751876 and rs35320474.
Moreover, two polymorphisms were also found: one allele carried a R171Q polymorphism (1/39 tumors), while a D418D polymorphism (GAC/GAT) was found in 15 and 8 tumors in hetero (CT) and homozygosity (TT), respectively.
RESULTS: We identified a patient homozygous for a nucleotide change c.1445T > G, resulting in a novel homozygous substitution of the non-polar hydrophobic phenylalanine to the polar hydrophilic cysteine in exon 6 at codon 482 (p.F482C) of the PKD2 gene and a de-novo PKD1 splice-site variant IVS21-2delAG.
Patch-clamping of PBMCs from the p.F482C homozygous and heterozygous subjects revealed lower polycystin-2 channel function than in controls.
Several variants (G59S, I97L, I220V, G296V, S322F, Y529C, and D541E) produced similar levels of RNase L activity as wild-type enzyme.
The metrics from DNA damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of common polymorphisms of the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes: a G-->C transversion at 1245 position of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser-->Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G-->C substitution at position 135 (5'-untranslated region) of the RAD51 gene (the G135C polymorphism).
We observed a strong association between gastric cancer occurrence, impaired DNA repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene.
We did not observe any correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired DNA repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA lesions.
Therefore, our result suggest that the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene may be linked with gastric cancer by the modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and this polymorphism may be a useful additional marker in this disease along with the genetic or/and environmental indicators of oxidative stress..
Three SNPs in the P2 promoter region (rs4810424, rs1884614, and rs2144908) were in almost complete association (D'>0.97, r (2)>0.95) and, therefore, only rs4810424 was included in further analyses.
Female carriers of the less frequent C allele of rs4810424 had a 1.7-fold elevated risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.66; P=0.020] for the conversion to diabetes compared to women with the common genotype after the adjustment for age, treatment group (placebo or acarbose), smoking, weight at baseline, and weight change.
RESULTS: Four SNPs, including rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514), and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), in CFH showed a significant association with wet AMD in the cohort of this study.
Unlike in other populations, rs2274700 and rs1410996 did not show a significant association with AMD in the Chinese population of this study.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that SNPs rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514), and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), but not rs7535263, rs1410996, or rs2274700, in CFH were significantly associated with wet AMD in a mainland Han Chinese population.
To analyze the factors possibly contributing to this phenotypic variability, we characterized the variations within the wild-type and mutant (Val30Met) TTR genes and their flanking sequences by performing extended microsatellite haplotype analyses, sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotyping of genomic DNA from Portuguese and Swedish carriers of V30M.
The data suggest that the onset of symptoms of FAP V30M may be modulated by an interval downstream of TTR on the accompanying noncarrier chromosome (defined by microsatellites D18S457 and D18S456), but not by the immediately 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences of TTR.
During the course of these studies, we also encountered the first instance in which the previously described intragenic haplotype III may be associated with V30M FAP in the Portuguese population..
Marker haplotypes around the DLL3 locus contradicted this hypothesis as three different haplotypes were seen in affected individuals, but sequence analysis showed that three unreported DLL3 mutations were segregating: a duplication of 17 bp in exon 8 (c.1285-1301dup), a single-nucleotide deletion in exon 5 (c.615delC), and a R238X nonsense mutation in exon 6.
In total, four novel mutations were identified; E137D (n=1), R32Q (n=1), E101K (n=1) and Y156H (n=1) and one mutation deletion; 366delT (n=1).
RESULTS: Five variants were identified: (1) a -866G/A in the 5' upstream region; (2) a G/A in exon 2; (3) a C/T resulting in an Ala55Val substitution in exon 4; and (4, 5) two insertion/deletions (ins/del; 45-bp and 3-bp) in the 3' untranslated region.
Among the 83 subjects whose DNA was sequenced, the -866G/A was in complete genotypic concordance with the Ala55Val and the 3-bp ins/del polymorphism.
To capture the common variation in this gene for association analyses, the -866G/A variant (as a representative of Ala55Val and the 3-bp ins/del polymorphism) and the 45-bp ins/del were also genotyped for 864 full-blooded Pima Indians.
However, in a subgroup of 185 subjects who had undergone detailed metabolic measurements, these variants were associated with 24-h energy expenditure as measured in a human metabolic chamber (p=0.007 for the 45-bp ins/del and p=0.03 for the -866G/A after adjusting for age, sex, family membership, fat-free mass and fat mass).
A1093C (Asn289His) in exon 10 and A 3199G (Asn991Asp) in exon 11 being found simultaneously in the patients of 2 families but not appearing in pool DNA sample, and Asn 371 His appearing as A/C heterozygote in pool DNA sample.
The phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene V175M single nucleotide polymorphism confers the susceptibility to NASH in Japanese population.
A functional polymorphism Val175Met was reported in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether the carriers of Val175Met variant impaired in PEMT activity are more susceptible to NASH.
RESULTS: Val175Met variant allele of the PEMT gene was significantly more frequent in NASH patients than in healthy volunteers (p<0.001), and carriers of Val175Met variant were significantly more frequent in NASH patients than in healthy volunteers (p<0.01).
Among NASH patients, body mass index was significantly lower (p<0.05), and non-obese patients were significantly more frequent (p<0.001) in carriers of Val175Met variant than in homozygotes of wild type PEMT.
CONCLUSIONS: Val175Met variant of PEMT could be a candidate molecule that determines the susceptibility to NASH, because it is more frequently observed in NASH patients and non-obese persons with Val175Met variant of PEMT are facilitated to develop NASH..
Among other genetic markers, thrombophilic genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A polymorphisms, as well as genetic variants of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, for  example, CYP19 and CYP1B1, have been established as genetic risk markers and disease modifiers of recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss and HRT-independent and -dependent breast cancer, respectively.
The second mutation is the di-nucleotide substitution c.467C>A and c.468C>T in exon 3 that causes the missense mutation A118D in the SEA domain of the extracellular stem region of matriptase-2.
We also demonstrate that the A118D SEA domain mutation causes an intra-molecular structural imbalance that impairs matriptase-2 activation.
These were 655A/G found in exon 8 of BRCA1, 1575T/C and 1767A/C found in exon 11 of the same gene.
RESULTS: The frequencies of mutant genotypes of INT4 and 3'UTR were significantly high in the pleurisy group (P = 0.01, P = 0.02), but the frequencies of D543N were not significantly different between the two groups.
The deletion generates a frameshift and a premature termination codon (c.1991-1993; p.(Asp569Valfs*93).
Eleven out of 47 GJB2-heterozygous patients analyzed carried the splice site mutation -3170G>A in the 5'UTR region of GJB2.
One out of these 11 patients showed homozygous -3170G>A genotype in combination with p.R127H.
Next to the GJB2 mutations we noted 2 cases of deletion in GJB6 [Delta(GJB6-D13S1830)] and 3 (2 new and 1 described) base substitutions in GJB3 [c.357C>T, c.798C>T and c.94C>T (p.R32W)] which are unlikely disease-causing.
Our results suggest the importance of routine screening for the rather frequent -3170G>A mutation (in addition to c.35delG) in patients with hearing impairment..
The first mutation was a G5947A substitution (R1851Q).
Compound heterozygotes (n=4) exhibited the lowest HDL-C (11+/-5 mg/dL) and ApoA-I (35+/-15 mg/dL) compared with wild-type (n=25) (HDL-C 51+/-14 mg/dL; ApoA-I 133+/-21 mg/dL) (P<0.0005) or subjects affected with either R1851Q (n=6) (HDL-C 36+/-8; ApoA-I 117+/-19) or IVS46: del T -39...-46 (n=5) (HDL-C 31+9; ApoA-I 115+28 (P<0.01).
Enzyme activity assays with recombinant CBR3 isoforms (CBR3 V244 and CBR3 M244) and the anthracycline substrate doxorubicin were used to investigate the functional impact of the CBR3 V244M polymorphism.
There was a trend toward an association between the CBR3 V244M polymorphism and the risk of CHF (OR, 8.16; P=.056 for G/G vs A/A; OR, 5.44; P=.092 for G/A vs A/A).
CONCLUSIONS: The functional CBR3 V244M polymorphism may have an impact on the risk of anthracycline-related CHF among childhood cancer survivors by modulating the intracardiac formation of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites.
The patient showed an R227Q mutation that has been described in an Asian population and MPH patients, along with a novel frameshift mutation, Tdel219.
The UGT1A1 enzyme activity was determined in COS7 cells transfected with wild or P364L (1091 C > T) mutant DNA.
RESULTS: Homozygous Y486D was observed in all four patients with CNS2.
Homozygous TA insertion in the TATA box (TA7) of the promoter region (TA7/7; 33%), homozygous G71R (9%), and combination of TA7/6 and heterozygous G71R (17%) were the most frequent findings in GS patients.
Homozygous or heterozygous Y486D (8%) and P229Q (8%) were also observed in GS.
In addition to GS patients, homozygous or heterozygous TA7, G71R, and heterozygous Y486D were also observed in healthy subjects.
The allele frequency of G71R and TA7 was 0.183 and 0.113 in healthy subjects, respectively.
The P364L UGT1A1 enzyme activity was 64.4% lower than the wild-type enzyme activity.
RESULTS: Family-based TDT showed a significant association of SLE with a N673S polymorphism in the P-selectin gene (SELP) (P = 5.74 x 10(-6)) and a C203S polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 gene (IRAK1) (P = 9.58 x 10(-6)).
However, SNP1 of UP Ia gene affecting a C to T conversion and an Ala7Val change, and SNP7 of UP III affecting a C to G conversion and a Pro154Ala change, were marginally associated with VUR (both P= 0.08).
An opposite effect was observed for the TLR4 D299G and TLR2 P631H variants, with a lower prevalence of ACCA antibodies (23.4% versus 35%, p = 0.013) and Omp antibodies (20.5% versus 34.6%, p = 0.009), respectively.
Eleven subjects presented SRD5A2 homozygous single-base mutations (two first cousins and four unrelated patients with G183S, two with R246W, one with del642T, one with G196S, and one with 217_218insC plus the A49T variant in heterozygosis), whereas four were compound heterozygotes (one with Q126R/IVS3+1G>A, one with Q126R/del418T, and two brothers with Q126R/G158R).
Three patients were heterozygous for A207D, G196S, and R266W substitutions.
The V89L polymorphism was found in heterozygosis in one of them (with A207D) and in one case with an otherwise normal gene sequence.
The A49T variant was also detected in heterozygosis in the second case without other sequencing abnormalities.
Four patients harbor yet non-described SRD5A2 gene mutations: a single nucleotide deletion (del642T), a G158R amino acid substitution, a splice junction mutation (IVS3+1G>A), and the insertion of a cytosine (217_218insC) occurring at a CCCC motif.
In addition to these new mutations, this investigation reveals the prevalence of G183S substitution among a subset of African-Brazilian patients and presents evidences of the recurrence of already known mutations..
Tumor thymidylate synthase 1494del6 genotype as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients receiving fluorouracil-based adjuvant treatment.
TS enhancer region, 3R G > C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and TS 1494del6 polymorphisms were assessed in both fresh-frozen normal mucosa and tumor.
Tumor TS 1494del6 allele (frequency of allelic loss, 36%) was protective (for each allele with the deletion, based on an additive model, HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.82; P = .0034).
CONCLUSION: Tumor TS 1494del6 genotype may be a prognostic factor in FU-based adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer patients..
Other less-recognised gene variations were detected throughout the RET gene in 70% of cases and included the 691 position on codon 11 (11 cases); the 432 position (4 cases, 1 homozygous) intronic mutations on exon 4 (1 case); and an IVS19-37G/C and a D1017N variation in exon 19 in 2 MEN families.
A functional Tyr1306Cys variant in LARG is associated with increased insulin action in vivo.
The strongest association with rate of glucose uptake was found with a Tyr1306Cys polymorphism (P < 0.0001, adjusted for age, sex, percent body fat, and nuclear family membership).
We propose that the Tyr1306Cys substitution in LARG, through its differential activation of RhoA, increases insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Pima Indians..
Its +1858C>T (R620W) polymorphism has been shown to associate with a risk for multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at positions -1123 (rs2488457), +1858 (rs2476601, the R620W substitution), and +2740 (rs1217412) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 372 subjects with childhood-onset T1D, 130 subjects with JIA, and 400 control subjects of Czech origin, and in 160 subjects with T1D and 271 healthy controls of Azeri origin.
ETS2 rs461155 showed high heterozygosity in DS.
Data obtained indicate that the rs2073601 'A' allele, responsible for nonsynonymous substitution of leucine to methionine, may have some role in DS in this population..
Variation at seven polymorphisms in four genes involved in the base excision repair (XRCC1 R194W, R399Q and a [AC]n microsatellite in the 3' UTR) and double strand break repair (XRCC3 T241M and a [AC]n microsatellite in intron 3 of XRCC3, XRCC4 I134T, and a GACTAn microsatellite located 120 kb 5' of XRCC5) pathways was determined for 291 retired radiation workers who had received cumulative occupational external radiation doses of between 0 and 1873 mSv.
Furthermore, the g.203A>C substitution altered the specific sequence of the steroid receptor for the glucocorticoid nuclear receptor (GR)/transcription factor in the PLN promoter, resulting in enhanced binding to the mutated DNA site.
These findings suggest that the g.203A>C genetic variant in the human PLN promoter may contribute to depressed contractility and accelerate functional deterioration in heart failure..
These included a novel c.210T > G transversion in homozygosity in exon 3 predicting a Tyr69X in the beta-sandwich domain in one patient.
Another patient was compound heterozygote for a novel c.791C > T transition predicting a Ser263Phe in the core domain and a novel c.2045-1G > A transition at the acceptor splice junction of intron 14.
One of them resulted from a single base 'G' duplication (c.892_895dupG) at codons Ser290/Ala291fs affecting the core domain and the other was due to a single base 'A' duplication (c.1642_1644dupA) and at codonTyr547fs affecting barrel-1 domain.
The remaining four patients had the previously reported Arg260His, Ser413Leu, and Val414Phe (n = 2) missense mutations in the core domain.
The fibrinogen gamma 10034C>T polymorphism is not associated with Peripheral Arterial Disease.
The FGG 10034C>T polymorphism was furthermore not associated with age at onset of PAD.
A human tumor xenograft (L56Br-X1) was established from a breast cancer axillary  lymph node metastasis of a 53-year-old woman with a BRCA1 germ-line nonsense mutation (1806C>T; Q563X), and a cell line (L56Br-C1) was subsequently derived from the xenograft.
The xenograft and cell line had retained a somatic TP53 missense  mutation (S215I) originating from the primary tumors, as well as a lack of immunohistochemically detectable expression of steroid hormone receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and keratin 8.
To do this, different constructs of the transactivation domain were selected as follows: (a) the wild-type transactivation domain; (b) two polymorphisms (S1613G  and M1652I); and (c) four cancer-predisposing mutations (A1708E, M1775R, W1837R and Y1853 term).
Direct sequencing of the TRbeta gene revealed a heterozygous transition 1284A>C in exon 9 resulting in substitution of glutamic acid 333 by aspartic acid residue (E333D).
We found that the E333D mutation neither significantly affected the affinity of the receptor for T3 nor modified heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptor (RXR) when bound to DNA.
However, in transient transfection assays, the E333D TRbeta mutant exhibited impaired transcriptional regulation on two distinct positively regulated thyroid response elements (F2- and DR4-TREs) as well as on the negatively regulated human TSHalpha promoter.
These results strongly suggest that the E333D TRbeta mutation is responsible for the RTH phenotype in the proposita's family..
The compound heterozygous mutations, c.892C>T and c.1072T>C, were identified in exon 3 of CHST6 in three patients.
A CASP8 promoter region six-nucleotide deletion/insertion (-652 6N ins/del) variant and a coding region D302H polymorphism are reportedly important in cancer development, but no reported study has assessed the associations of these genetic variations with risk of head and neck cancer.
In five patients p.R246Q missense mutation was detected, of which four were homozygous and one was compound heterozygous: g.80_87delT CGCGAAG (p.A27fsX132) and p.R246Q.
Another patient with isolated micropenis harbored a heterozygous p.G196S missense mutation.
In conclusion, our study suggests that p.R246Q mutation is common amongst patients with SRD5A2 gene defect from the Northern states of India.
A G1103R mutation in CRB1 is co-inherited with high hyperopia and Leber congenital amaurosis.
Linkage was obtained to 1q31.3 with a maximal LOD score of 5.20 and a mutation found in exon 9 of the CRB1 gene, causing a G1103R substitution at a highly conserved site in the protein.
The E873stop mutation produces a premature termination codon (TAG) in exon 17.
The A467T mutation produces a threonine to alanine substitution at a highly conserved site in exon 7.
More than 95% of the functional POLG mRNA was derived from the allele bearing the A467T mutation and less than 5% contained the E873stop mutation.
These events ensured that virtually all POLG protein in the cell was expressed from the A467T allele.
Therefore, the Alpers phenotype in this patient was a consequence of a single-copy gene dose of the A467T allele, and selective elimination of transcripts bearing the E873stop mutation..
TNFA -308G>A in two international population-based cohorts and risk of asthma.
The TNFA -308G>A polymorphism was associated with increased asthma prevalence and with bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
The LTA 252A>G polymorphism was not associated with any of the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The DeltaG91 mutation in CRYBA3/A1 is associated with an autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract.
The TREX1 exonuclease R114H mutation in Aicardi-Gouti  res syndrome and lupus reveals dimeric structure requirements for DNA degradation activity.
The TREX1 proteins containing R114H and the insertion mutations aspartate at position 201 (D201ins) and alanine at position 124 (A124ins), found in compound heterozygous AGS with R114H, were prepared and the DNA degradation activities were tested.
This interpretation is further supported by exonuclease activities measured for TREX1 enzymes containing R114A and R114K mutations.
Risk factors for breast cancer characterized by the estrogen receptor alpha A908G (K303R) mutation.
A point mutation in the estrogen receptor alpha gene, ESR1, referred to as A908G or K303R, was originally identified in breast hyperplasias and was reported to be hypersensitive to estrogen.
METHODS: In this report, we evaluated risk factors for invasive breast cancer classified according to the presence or absence of the ESR1 A908G mutation in the CBCS, a population-based case-control study of breast cancer among younger and older white and African-American women in North Carolina.
Of the 653 breast tumors evaluated, 37 were ESR1 A908G mutation-positive and 616 were mutation-negative.
RESULTS: ESR1 A908G mutation-positive breast cancer was significantly associated  with a first-degree family history of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 6.28), whereas mutation-negative breast cancer was not.
There was also the suggestion that longer duration of oral contraceptive (OC) use (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.16 to 12.03; Ptrend = 0.02 for use of more than 10 years) and recent use of OCs (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 0.80 to 16.45; Ptrend = 0.10 for use within 10 years) were associated with ESR1 A908G mutation-positive breast cancer; however, ORs for comparison of the two case subgroups were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that OCs may interact with the ESR1 A908G mutant receptor to drive the development of some breast tumors..
METHODS: We combined Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS; AstraZeneca) allele-specific PCR and Scorpions (DxS) to develop assays for tumor-borne PIK3CA  mutations and used real-time PCR to develop high-throughput multiplexed assays for the most commonly reported PIK3CA mutants (H1047L, H1047R, E542K, E545K).
Analysis of complementary DNA showed that the heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G>C caused the appearance of 2 RNA molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 (r.2521_2634del).
RESULTS: The promoter indel and rs2070197 had independent genetic effects, which accounted for the association of rs2004640 and rs10954213.
Gene expression analysis revealed that rs10954213 exerted the greatest influence on IRF5 transcript levels.
CONCLUSION: We corroborated the association of the promoter indel with SLE in 5 different populations and revealed that rs10954213 is the main single-nucleotide polymorphism responsible for altered IRF5 expression in PBMC..
The affected individuals carry a novel missense substitution, p.D572H (c.G1714C), of the TMC1 gene.
This mutation is at the same nucleotide and amino acid position as the only other reported DFNA36 mutation, p.D572N (c.G1714A).
RESULTS: In the proband, direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product from amplified coding regions of KRT3 and KRT12 revealed a novel 1493A>T heterozygous missense mutation in exon 7 of KRT3, which predicts the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at codon 498 (E498V).
CONCLUSIONS: Location of the E498V mutation emphasizes the functional relevance of the highly conserved boundary motifs at the COOH-terminus of the alpha-helical rod domain in keratin 3 (K3)..
In MD, a recurrent P799L mutation was identified in nine subjects, as well as 10 novel mutations including F471del, the first deletion mutation of TRPV4.
In SMDK, a recurrent R594H mutation was identified in 12 subjects and seven novel mutations.
A novel His158Arg mutation in TIMP3 causes a late-onset form of Sorsby fundus dystrophy.
A heterozygous His158Arg mutation was found in seven affected family members and was absent from an unaffected member and 98 unrelated controls.
His158Arg is the first reported TIMP3 SFD coding sequence mutation that does not create an unpaired cysteine.
CONCLUSIONS: A1180V expresses a mild Na(+) channel phenotype in vitro and a corresponding clinical phenotype in unaffected mutation carriers, implying that A1180V caused structural heart disease in affected carriers by disturbing Na(+) influx and, hence, cellular Na(+) homeostasis.
The high penetrance of A1180V suggests this phenotype as a high risk factor for dilated cardiomyopathy with preceding atrioventricular block..
In molecular studies, the effect of the APOE -491A/T (rs449647) polymorphism on gene transcription was accessed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays.
In 630 cases and 595 controls, three APOE promoter SNPs -491A/T, -219G/T (rs405509), and +113G/C (rs440446) were genotyped and tested for association with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: At molecular level, polymorphism -491A/T and ATF4 elicit independent control of APOE gene expression.
Genomic DNA from cases and controls was analyzed for genetic polymorphism in codon 432 (Val-->Leu) of the CYP1B1 gene using a PCR-RFLP-based assay.
The polymorphism rs2234671 at position Ex2+860G>C of the CXCR1 gene causes a conservative amino acid substitution (S276T).
In this study we investigated the polymorphism rs2234671 in 395 Brazilian subjects with and without chronic periodontitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism rs2234671 in the CXCR1 gene was not associated with the susceptibility to chronic periodontitis in the studied Brazilian population..
Nine distinct mutations including one small deletion mutation (46delS), two small insertion mutations (118-119insA and 125-126insAA), and six non-synonymous mutations (A6V, P163S, E359K, P407Q, S429T and A442V) were identified in 12 of the 486 patients (nine with ventricular septal defect, two with Tetralogy of Fallot, and one with endocardial cushion defect).
Of them, two patients carrying E359K mutation were from two generations in one family with ventricular septal defect (VSD).
Interestingly, a nucleotide insertion of c.1146+25insA in exon 6 was detected in five VSD patients, but not in 486 normal healthy controls.
Segregation of a M404V mutation of the p62/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene with polyostotic Paget's disease of bone in an Italian family.
Extension of the genetic analysis to other relatives in this family demonstrated segregation of the M404V mutation with the polyostotic PDB phenotype and provided the identification of six asymptomatic gene carriers.
Of the five clinically ascertained affected members of the family, four possessed the M404V mutation and exhibited the polyostotic form of PDB, except one patient with a single X-ray-assessed skeletal localization and one with a polyostotic disease who had died several years before the DNA analysis.
By both reconstitution and mutational analysis of the pedigree, six unaffected subjects were shown to bear the M404V mutation, representing potential asymptomatic gene carriers whose circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase were recently assessed as still within the normal range.
Taken together, these results support a genotype-phenotype correlation between the M404V mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene and a polyostotic form of PDB in this family.
Allelic expression imbalance of human mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) caused by variant A118G.
Genetic variants of OPRM1 have been implicated in predisposition to drug addiction, in particular the single nucleotide polymorphism A118G, leading to an N40D substitution, with an allele frequency of 10-32%, and uncertain functions.
We have measured allele-specific mRNA expression of OPRM1 in human autopsy brain tissues, using A118G as a marker.
Here, a homozygous missense mutation in position 1829 (A(R)G) of the GPIX gene constituting a N45S substitution is the cause for the bleeding symptoms.
A total of 38 family members within two generations were analyzed regarding the N45S mutation by DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism.
In TIOD families the results were as follows: (1) a homozygous GGCC insertion at exon 8, position 1277 (family 1); (2) compound heterozygosity with a GGCC insertion at exon 8 (1277) and a nucleotide substitution in exon 11 (2068G>C) (family 2); (3) compound heterozygosity with the mutation 2068G>C in exon 11 and a C insertion in exon 14 between positions 2505-2511 (family 3).
Sequence analysis of the proband's FXII gene revealed a homozygous nucleotide substitution G --> C in exon 12, resulting in the amino acid substitution W486C in the catalytic domain.
On the other hand, both the wild-type FXII and W486C cell lysates contained FXII antigen and FXII mRNA, as estimated by western blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
These findings suggest that the W486C substitution of FXII impairs intracellular processing of the protein and/or transport system..
In LCD, three novel heterozygous mutations found were glycine-594-valine (Gly594Val) in 2 of 18 patients, valine-539-aspartic acid (Val539Asp) in 1 patient, and deletion of valine 624, valine 625 (Val624-Val625del) in 1 patient.
Atypical clinical features for LCD were noted in patients with the Gly594Val and Val624-Val625del mutations.
In GCD, 18 patients with GCD type I had a mutation of arginine 555-to-tryptophan (Arg555Trp) and 1 patient with GCD type III (Reis-Bucklers dystrophy), had the Arg124Leu mutation.
Seven novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also found, of which a change of leucine 269 to phenylalanine (Leu269Phe) was found in 12 of 18 patients with the Arg555Trp mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Arg124Cys and Arg555Trp appear to be the predominant mutations causing LCD and GCD, respectively, in the population studied.
RESULTS: In the case-control design, the frequencies of the TT genotype for SNP rs2277025 and the homozygous deletion variant (157delMTTTVP) in the fourth exon of the TIM-1 gene were higher among patients with patients with asthma compared with the controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.779, P = .016; and OR, 3.09, P = .022, respectively).
This association was substantiated by haplotype analysis of these and 2 additional SNPs (OR, 2.48; P = .004), and also by family-based tests for the allele and haplotype carrying 157delMTTTVP (P = .009 and P = .048, respectively).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion and angiotensin type 1 receptor A1166C polymorphisms as genetic risk factors in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.
The present study was aimed at searching for an association of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia with the I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene and the A1166C polymorphism in the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AGT1R) gene and at comparing allele frequencies between both groups and the general population.
Replication in a sample of 137 affected White children and 239 controls showed that only rs6589664 (MLL) was significantly associated in this ethnic group.
In addition, we described a polymorphism within LIX1 intron 3, c.387+107A>T.
A higher frequency of the C35322T SNP was observed among hypertensive patients than control subjects.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85alpha regulatory subunit gene Met326Ile polymorphism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
In its regulatory subunit, p85alpha, there is a common amino acid substitution (the Met326Ile polymorphism), and this amino acid may be crucial for the function of the p85alpha regulatory subunit and PI3-kinase.
METHODS: Analysis of the Met326Ile polymorphism was carried out on DNA samples from 256 PCOS patients and 283 controls.
RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the Met326Ile polymorphism in the PCOS group was not different from that of the controls (Met326Met/Met326Ile/Ile326Ile rates were 73.4%/23.4%/3.2% and 70.3%/26.1%/3.6% for the PCOS and control groups, respectively, P = 0.72).
Compared with those carrying at least one variant 326Ile allele, carriers with the Met326Met genotype had higher serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) {1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.3] ng/ml in those with the Met326Met genotype versus 0.8 (95% CI 0.7-1.0) ng/ml in those with Ile326Ile and Met326Ile genotypes, P = 0.0073} and free testosterone levels [1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.4) pg/ml for Met326Met genotype versus 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.3) pg/ml for Ile326Ile and Met326Ile genotypes, P = 0.038].
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the PI3-kinase gene Met326Ile polymorphism may not be a major determinant for the development of PCOS, but it may modulate the concentrations of serum 17-OHP or free testosterone in PCOS patients..
A substitution G/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene at position -1082 has been associated with different amounts of IL-10 production.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible links between -1082(G/A) polymorphism of the IL-10 gene and the generalized form of aggressive periodontitis.
RESULTS: The 16C-->A SNP (reference SNP no.
All 5 patients were heterozygous for a base substitution c.201C>A changing the tyrosine codon at amino acid position 67 into a stop codon (p.Y67X) in exon 4.
We also found a similar electrophysiological profile for the neighboring V1764M mutant.
But, the other neighboring I1762A mutant had no persistent current and was still associated with a positive shift of inactivation.
Results: Three different sequence variants, c.-17T>C, c.171T>C, c.465G>T were identified.
The sequence variant c.465G>T encodes a conservative amino acid substitution, p.Glu155Asp, located in EF-hand 4, the calcium binding site of GCAP2 protein.
The heterozygous c.973G>A transition in exon 9 resulted in a substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at amino acid 325 (E325K) in the second calcium-binding EGF domain.
In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16864880 in the downstream flanking region (DFR) of p63 exon 8 was also identified in this family.
RESULTS: A missense disease-associated mutation, c.1922G>A (p.Arg641His), was identified for which the patient was homozygous.
Whether the c.1922G>A mutation is responsible for a yet undescribed pseudodeficiency of beta-mannosidase is also discussed..
The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p.
In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G>A was identified in the 3'-untranslated region in one patient.
The SNPs selected for analysis were F31I (rs2273535) in AURKA, N372H (rs144848) in BRCA2,  rs2854344 in intron 17 of RB1, rs2811712 5' flanking CDKN2A, rs523349 in the 3' UTR of SRD5A2, D302H (rs1045485) in CASP8 and L10P (rs1982073) in TGFB1.
DNA sequence analysis revealed that the proband had apparent homozygosity for a novel single point mutation (g.3907G >A) changing the codon for Glu29 to Lys (E29K); neither parent had the E29K mutation.
By analogy with the previously reported factor IX San Dimas, the R-4Q mutation probably causes under-carboxylation of prothrombin and poor cleavage of the propeptide in the hepatocyte.
To evaluate this phenomenon, the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (A to G transition in exon7 leading to amino acid substitution Ile462Val and T3801C at 3'UTR) of CYP1A1 gene in prostate cancer were analyzed in a case-control study of 100 individuals in South Indian population.
The missense mutation in Patient 1, c.3943G>A (p.G1315R) in exon 20, was identified in a previous report.
Ser704Cys DISC1 SNP was genotyped using the TaqMan 5'-exonuclease allelic discrimination assay.
KEY FINDINGS: We found that the Cys704 allele of Ser704Cys SNP was associated with an increased risk of CFS development compared with the Ser704 allele.
SIGNIFICANCE: DISC1 Ser704Cys might be a functional variant that affects one of the mechanisms implicated in the biology of CFS.
Despite the variety of patients with CFS, DISC1 Ser704Cys has an association with CFS, which may also suggest that DISC1 plays a central role in the induction of various psychiatric diseases..
Evaluation of the Lys198Asn and -134delA genetic polymorphisms of the endothelin-1 gene.
One is the Lys198Asn polymorphism, which showed a positive association with BP in overweight people.
In this study, we investigated the expression of the Lys198Asn polymorphism in ET-1 in vitro, as well as the association between either of the two polymorphisms and the plasma ET-1 level.
Our transient expression study indicates that the Lys198Asn polymorphism may not directly affect ET-1 and big ET-1 production.
Another variant in the EDN1 gene in linkage disequilibrium with the Lys198Asn polymorphism may be responsible for the association with BP, or the interaction between the EDN1 Lys198Asn polymorphism and other factors such as obesity may be involved in the mechanisms elevating BP in vivo..
The HH genotype of the nonconservative amino acid substitution polymorphism N372H in the BRCA2 gene was reported to be associated with a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.
As these studies concerned sporadic cancer cases, we investigated whether N372H and another common variant located in the 5'-untranslated region (203G > A) of the BRCA2 gene modify breast or ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers.
In respect of ovarian cancer risk, we also saw no effect with the N372H variant but we did observe a borderline association with the 5'-untranslated region 203A allele (hazard ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.01-2.00).
on newborn females and adult female controls, we found no departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the distribution of N372H alleles for our female BRCA1 carriers.
We conclude that if these single-nucleotide polymorphisms do modify the risk of cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers, their effects are not significantly larger than that of N372H previously observed in the general population..
Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G>A (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS).
However, the 14538 G>A (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome.
The commonest mutation is the p.Asp50Asn mutation, and only a few other mutations have been described to date.
Using direct sequencing a point mutation (144 G>A) resulting in a Q48H substitution in exon 1 of the MYOC gene was observed in five of the eight glaucoma patients, but not in unaffected family members and 100 unrelated controls.
Data presented here supports the hypothesis that congenital microcoria is a potential risk factor for glaucoma, although this observation is complicated by the partial segregation of MYOC Q48H (1q24.3-q25.2), a mutation known to be associated with glaucoma in India.
The relationship between microcoria, glaucoma, and the MYOC Q48H mutation in this family is discussed..
In this report, we demonstrate that wild type but not the dominant-negative mutant (V143A) or cancer-specific mutants (R175H or R280K) of p53 repress CXCR4 expression.
Among them, V311fs and Y329fs are two novel frame-shifting mutations.
V311fs is an 8-bp nucleotide (TTAAATGG) deletion in exon 5.
Y329fs is a deletion-insertion combined mutation (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 in exon 6.
Two homozygotes for Y329fs and one compound heterozygote for Y329fs and V311fs were identified from three different families.
The identification of Y329fs mutation in addition to three previously identified mutations at codon 329 suggests that codon 329 is an unstable point of the CYP17 gene.
The mutations identified from our five patients appear to be random, but the recurrence of the Y329fs mutation may be attributed to a founder effect.
The G51S purine nucleoside phosphorylase polymorphism is associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients.
Our findings suggest that the G51S PNP polymorphism is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline in AD patients, highlighting the important role of purine metabolism in the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder..
An improved tetra-primer PCR approach for the detection of the FGFR3 G380R mutation responsible for achondroplasia.
We have developed a sensitive single tube tetra-primer PCR assay to detect both the c.1138G>A and c.1138G>C mutations and can successfully distinguish DNA samples that are homozygous and heterozygous for the c.1138G>A mutation.
The assay has been tested in 50 healthy controls, 3 known patients with achondroplasia, and 5 amniotic fluids suspected of having achondroplasia and for whom we had previously determined the genotypes for the c.1138G>A mutation by PCR-RFLP.
Our tetra-primer PCR assay is sensitive, low-cost, and easy to use method for FGFR3 p.G380R genotyping, which could be used even in "low-tech" laboratories..
An epidemiological study was done in sporadic PCa (n=98) and BPH (n=143) using 1 novel (Ser627Leu) and 2 previously described polymorphisms of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene.
A common missense single nucleotide polymorphism in the human FPR1 gene at nucleotide c.32C>T results in the amino-acid substitution, p.I11T, in the FPR1 extracellular amino-terminus.
When expressed in HEK 293 and RBL-2H3 cells a substantial proportion of FPR1 p.I11T variant is retained intracellularly and agonist-independent internalization of the FPR1 p.I11T variant, but not the wild-type FPR1, is constitutively associated with beta-arrestin2-GFP in vesicles.
Genotype rs8099917 near the IL28B gene and amino acid substitution at position 70 in the core region of the hepatitis C virus are determinants of serum apolipoprotein B-100 concentration in chronic hepatitis C.
Our results demonstrated that both the aa 70 substitution in the core region of the HCV and the rs8099917 SNP located proximal to the IL28B were independent factors in determining serum apoB-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.
A significant association was also observed between subjects carrying the rs8099917 TT responder genotype and higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 6.4   10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 4.2   10(-3)).
In particular, serum apoB-100 concentration might be an informative marker for judging changes in HCV-associated intracellular lipoprotein metabolism in patients carrying the rs8099917 responder genotype..
However, evidence supporting a role for PTPN22 in type 1 diabetes derives entirely from the study of just one coding single nucleotide polymorphism, 1858C/T.
These results support the conclusion that the 1858C/T allele is the major risk variant for type 1 diabetes in the PTPN22 locus, but they suggest that additional infrequent coding variants at PTPN22 may also contribute to type 1 diabetes risk..
In DNA from the breast and liver tumors the authors showed the same missense mutation in codon 245 (GGC-->GAC; Gly-->Asp) of exon 7 of p53.
These include C219W-alpha (TGC to TGG) in the E1alpha subunit; H156Y-beta (CAT to TAT), V69G-beta (GTT to GGT), IVS 9 del[-7:-4], and 1109 ins 8bp (exon 10) in the E1beta subunit; and H391R (CAC to CGC) and S133stop (TCA to TGA) affecting the E2 subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex.
The H391R substitution in the E2 subunit abolishes the key catalytic residue that functions as a general base in the acyltransfer reaction, resulting in a completely inactive E2 component.
We propose that the augmented E1 activity is responsible for robust thiamin responsiveness in homozygous patients carrying the H391R E2 mutation and that the presence of a full-length mutant E2 is diagnostic of this MSUD phenotype.
The role of the CCR5 Delta32 polymorphism in abdominal aortic aneurysms.
The CCR5 gene is associated with a 32 base pair deletion (the Delta32 polymorphism).
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the CCR5 Delta32 polymorphism in the development of AAA.
Flow cytometry was used to investigate the biological activity of the Delta32 polymorphism.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the AAA and the control group in relation to the Delta32 allele frequency (AAA group 10%, control group = 12%, P = 0.82, chi-squared analysis).
Delta32 homozygotes = 2% and 2%, respectively, P = 0.33, chi-squared analysis).
The polymorphism was shown to be biologically active with the number of Delta32 alleles correlating with cell expression of ccr5 as detected with flow cytometry (P < or = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the ccr5 Delta32 is a biologically active genetic polymorphism; however, there is no association between this polymorphism and AAA..
Characterization of the breast cancer associated ATM 7271T>G (V2424G) mutation by gene expression profiling.
We previously reported one breast cancer family in which ATM 7271T>G (V2424G) segregated with disease, and apparently acted in a  dominant negative manner.
We now report the screening of 782 multiple-case breast cancer families that identified two additional index cases with ATM 7271T>G.
Cluster analysis revealed 77 genes  that were differentially expressed in homozygous and heterozygous V2424G cells (compared to wild-type) and 11 genes differentially expressed in the homozygous cells.
We also evaluated the profiles of LCLs after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and identified 77 genes that were differentially expressed in wild-type cells, but not in homozygous or heterozygous V2424G cells.
We validated the expression differences by RT-PCR in additional heterozygous V2424G LCLs from  another breast cancer family.
We found no consistent cytotoxicity or abrogation of ATM kinase activity after IR in seven heterozygous V2424G LCLs, compared to wild-type LCLs, but did find an increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations.
These data suggest that the V2424G missense mutation acts largely as a dominant negative in terms of the associated expression profiles..
The M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene in South Indian patients of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
The objective of the present study was to examine the association of the T704C polymorphism of exon 2 of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene with HCM in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh.
Two heterozygous DNA sequence variations were solely present in one single patient each but in none of the 20 normal controls: a duplication of GCC (c.97GCC[9]+[10]) resulting in an extra alanine within exon 1 and a 25*G>A substitution in the 3'-untranslated region.
Two patients carried a c.262G>A sequence variation predicting for an Ala88Thr exchange which was also detected in 2 normal controls.
Two silent mutations, c.1272C>T (Ser424Ser) and c.1284T>C (Tyr428Tyr), respectively, occurred in the coding region of exon 2, again in both patients and normal controls.
hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and risk of lung cancer by histological type.
Although several studies have investigated the association between rs1052133 and lung cancer susceptibility, the effect of this locus on lung cancer according to histology remains unclear.
These results indicate that rs1052133 contributes to the risk of adenocarcinoma of lung..
We identified such a mechanism as the origin of the mild to asymptomatic phenotype observed in cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the E831X mutation (2623G>T) in the CFTR gene.
One proband had compound heterozygous mutations, with a PRKN exon 2 deletion and an exon 7 G284R substitution.
The 2 remaining carriers had novel heterozygous exon 11 R396G substitutions.
RNASEL, encoding the 2',5'-oligoadenylate-dependant RNase L, seems to have rare mutations in different ethnicities, such as M1I in Afro-Americans, E265X in men of European descent and 471delAAAG in Ashkenazi Jews.
We identified only two sib pairs (1.4% of our families) cosegregating conspicuous RNASEL variants with prostate cancer:  the nonsense mutation E265X, and a new amino-acid substitution (R400P) of unknown functional relevance.
No significant association of polymorphisms (I97L, R462Q and D541E) was observed, neither in case-control analyses nor by family-based association tests.
These isoforms were associated with a heterozygous E441G mutation and a heterozygous 1.7-kbp deletion in the promoter region of the PTPN6 gene.
This report presents clinical, neuropathological and molecular genetic data from 2 families in France with an identical p53 germline mutation in codon 248 (CGG->TGG; Arg->Trp) and a clustering of CNS tumors.
Apparent homozygosity for the mutation p.R315X present on exon 5 of the arylsulfatase B (ARSB) gene in a mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patient was solved in this study by further testing for a second mutation.
Patient cDNA analysis revealed that the entire exon 5 of the ARSB gene was lacking; this new mutation was identified as c.899-1142del.
The loci T1270533G and C1256088C were selected for the case-control study using the tetra-Primer ARMS-PCR, as well as the sequencing method.
Missense mutation occurred in the polymorphic loci of T1270533G and C1256088C.
However, no evident relationships between the variants of T1270533G and clinical phenotypes of NPC were observed in the NPC group and healthy control group (OR = 0.170, 95%CI = 0.95-0.306 for homozygote TT).
CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism of T1270533G does not affect the detoxification function of GSTM1.
The T1270533G locus has no apparent association with genetic susceptibility to NPC in the southern China population.
XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphism and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in the Polish population.
It has been shown that DNA repair is reduced in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and that the X-ray repair cross-complementing (XRCC1) Arg399Gln (rs25487) polymorphism may contribute to DNA repair.
We evaluated the frequency of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln substitution in patients with SLE (n=265) and controls (n=360) in a sample of the Polish population.
There was also a statistically significant p-value of the   (2) test for the trend observed in the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism (ptrend=0.0048).
Our studies may confirm that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism may increase the risk of incidence of SLE and the occurrence of some SLE manifestations..
Three were nonsense mutations: c.507G>T (p.E169stop), c.867G>T (p.G289stop), c.897G>T (p.E299stop) and the fourth a single nucleotide insertion c.1558-1559insA (p.S522fs 525stop).
L1503R is a member of group I mutation and has dominant-negative effect on secretion of full-length VWF multimers: an analysis of two patients with type 2A von Willebrand disease.
Sequence analysis of the VWF gene from two unrelated type 2A VWD patients showed an identical, novel, heterozygous T-->G transversion at nucleotide 4508, resulting in the substitution of L1503R in the VWF A2 domain.
Molecular dynamic simulations of structural changes induced by L1503R indicated that the mean value of all-atom root-mean-squared-deviation was shifted from those with wild type or another mutation L1503Q that has been reported to be a group II mutation, which is susceptible to ADAMTS13 proteolysis.
Protein instability of L1503R may be responsible for its intracellular retention and perhaps the larger VWF multimers, containing more mutant VWF subunits, are likely to be mal-processed and retained within the cell..
DNA analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for mutations of GHR, including a previously reported R211H mutation and a novel duplication of a nucleotide in exon 9 (899dupC), the latter resulting in a frameshift and a premature stop codon.
We produced recombinant human tRNase ZL's, which contain one to three amino-acid substitutions from three missense mutations (Ser217Leu, Ala541Thr, and Arg781His) that are associated with the occurrence of  prostate cancer.
R58fs mutation in the HGD gene in a family with alkaptonuria in the UAE.
The R58fs mutation is old, perhaps having occurred several thousand years ago, and has spread over a large geographical area..
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: We identified the novel homozygous mutation c.908G>A within exon 8 of the CTSK gene.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between 6bINS and the vascular complication pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc in a French Caucasian population.
We observed a significant lower frequency of 6bINS allele in SSc patients with associated PAH compared with controls [10.3 vs 23.9%, P = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.89], and a trend in comparison with SSc patients without PAH (10.3 vs 20.3%, P = 0.05; OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.19-1.08).
Genotypes carrying allele 6bINS were also less frequent in SSc patients with PAH than in controls (20.7 vs 42.9%, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Thus the frequency of 6bINS differs between SSc patients with or without PAH, suggesting the implication of ENG in this devastating vascular complication of SSc..
None of the previously reported mutations was detected, but four novel mutations (V387M, N435S, V447A, and L452M) were found in the kinase domain in recurrent tumors.
RESULTS: Along with the G2355C (S761N) missense mutation previously identified in a uterine cancer, we found two other variants in breast cancers, T2006C (C645R) and A2286G (I738V).
The T2006C (C645R) mutation was also found in one ovarian tumour.
A variant of uncertain consequence, G1743C (C557S), was found to be homozygous or hemizygous in an ovarian tumour.
CONCLUSIONS: These activities allowed us to identify one of the rare variants (A2286G; I738V) as a neutral polymorphism rather than a detrimental mutation, and suggested that G1743C (C557S) is not a polymorphism but may contribute to the cancer phenotype..
Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated (in map order): exon 2, 15T-->C encodes an amino acid substitution Phe-->Ser at codon 15; intron 2, -352G-->A; intron 3, +45C-->T; intron 4, +718C-->T, determined by SNaPshot assay.
FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism and prostate cancer risk in Scottish men.
The single nucleotide polymorphism Gly(388)Arg in FGFR4 is not associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in Scottish men.
IRF4 intron 4 SNP rs12203592 showed a male-specific risk association (OR=4.4, 95% CI=1.5 to 12.6, P=0.007).
We found a repressive effect of the rs12203592 wildtype allele C on IRF4 promoter activity (P<0.001) but no repression by the variant allele in any cell line tested.
Thus, homozygosity for the rs12203592 variant allele would result in increased IRF4 expression.
The mtDNA A3243G mutation was the most common causal genotype in this patient group (79/92 and 85.9%).
The second common gene mutation was G13513A (7/92 and 7.6%).
Additionally, we identified T10191C (p.S45P) in ND3, A11470C (p.
K237N) in ND4, T13046C (p.M237T) in ND5 and a large-scale deletion (13025-13033:14417-14425) involving partial ND5 and ND6 subunits of complex I in one patient each.
Among them, A11470C, T13046C and the single deletion were novel mutations.
In patient 2, sequence analysis revealed a compound heterozygosis for the already reported 313delT (C105Vfs114X) mutation and for a second novel mutation in exon 3, substituting G for A at cDNA nucleotide position 323, resulting in a C88Y change.
Data from in silico analysis confirmed that the C88Y mutation would affect subunit conformation.
Indeed, two different bioinformatics approaches, PolyPhen and SIFT analysis, predicted C88Y to be a damaging substitution.
RESULTS: Sequencing of the coding region of GJA3 showed the presence of a novel, heterozygous C260T change in one family (CC-472) who had two affected members.
The observed C260T substitution created a novel restriction enzyme site for NlaIII and resulted in substitution of highly conserved threonine at position 87 by methionine (T87M).
Computer prediction indicated that the C111G polymorphism, which occurs 12 bases upstream from the translation start codon, might alter the secondary structure of the transcript.
All four SNPs of SLC2A2 predicted the conversion to diabetes, and rs5393 (AA genotype) increased the risk of type 2 diabetes in the entire study population by threefold (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.34-6.88, P = 0.008).
