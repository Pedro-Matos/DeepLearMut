22125978	Identification of LIPH gene mutation in a consanguineous family segregating the woolly hair/hypotrichosis phenotype.	OBJECTIVE: To identify the disease causing gene in a four generation consanguineous family in which eleven family members were suffering from Woolly hair/hypotrichosis phenotype. METHODS: Linkage analysis was carried out to identify the disease-causing gene in this family. Genomic DNA of all the available family members was genotyped for the microsatellite markers for all the known woolly hair/hypotrichosis loci.Automated DNA sequencing of the candidate gene was performed to identify the disease-causing mutation. RESULTS: By using homozygosity linkage analysis we have mapped the family on chromosome 3q27.3 with a two point LOD score of 4.04, Mutation screening of the LIPH gene revealed a homozygous c.659_660delTA deletion mutation segregating with the disease phenotype. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the c.659_660delTA mutation in the LIPH gene cause autosomal recessive WH/hypotrichosis phenotype in this family. This mutation has been reported in several Pakistani and Guyanese families suggesting a founder mutation in the LIPH gene in Indo-Pak sub-continent.
