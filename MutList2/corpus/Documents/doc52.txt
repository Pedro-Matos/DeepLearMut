16039774	The 5alpha-reductase type II A49T and V89L high-activity allelic variants are more common in men with prostate cancer compared with the general population.	OBJECTIVES: To compare men with prostate disease with those from the general population regarding polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene and in the 5alpha-reductase II (SRD5A2) gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SRD5A2 polymorphisms A49T, V89L and R227Q, the androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeats and sex hormone status was investigated in  men with prostate cancer (CaP) (n=89), benign prostate hyperplasia (n=45) and healthy military conscripts (n=223). RESULTS: The SRD5A2 high-activity allele variants A49T AT and V89L LL were more frequent in CaP-patients compared to general population, p=0.026 and p=0.05, respectively. CaP progression was, however, independent of SRD5A2 variants. In contrary, men with GGN<23 had a higher risk of dying from the disease than their  counterparts with longer repeats. CONCLUSIONS: Men with CaP were more often genetically predisposed to a higher enzymatic activity in the turn over from T to DHT compared to the general population. In our population, androgen receptor genotype affected CaP outcome.
