16563154	Influence of the MDM2 single nucleotide polymorphism SNP309 on tumour development in BRCA1 mutation carriers.	BACKGROUND: The MDM2 gene encodes a negative regulator of the p53 tumour suppressor protein. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MDM2 promoter (a T to G exchange at nucleotide 309) has been reported to produce accelerated tumour formation in individuals with inherited p53 mutations. We have investigated the effect of the MDM2 SNP309 on clinical outcome in a cohort of patients with germline mutations of BRCA1. METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained for 102 healthy controls and 116 patients with  established pathogenic mutations of BRCA1 and Pyrosequencing technologytrade mark was used to determine the genotype at the MDM2 SNP309 locus. RESULTS: The polymorphism was present in 52.9% of the controls (G/T in 37.3% and  G/G in 15.6%) and 58.6% of the BRCA1 mutation carriers (47.4% G/T and 11.2% G/G). Incidence of malignancy in female BRCA1 carriers was not significantly higher in  SNP309 carriers than in wildtype (T/T) individuals (72.7% vs. 75.6%, p = 1.00). Mean age of diagnosis of first breast cancer was 41.2 years in the SNP309 G/G genotype carriers, 38.6 years in those with the SNP309 G/T genotype and 39.0 years in wildtype subjects (p = 0.80). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that the MDM2 SNP309 accelerates tumour development in carriers of known pathogenic germline mutations of BRCA1.
