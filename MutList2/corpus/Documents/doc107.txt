9815913	p53 mutation and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.	A substantial portion of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer fail to respond to estrogen depletion or to the antiestrogen tamoxifen. The molecular changes that lead to tamoxifen resistance and estrogen-independent growth are unknown. To test the hypothesis that a p53 mutation could result in tamoxifen resistance and estrogen-independent growth, the MCF-7 cell line was transfected with p53 cDNA which was mutated at codon 179 (histidine to glutamine). MCF-7 is an estrogen receptor-positive, estrogen-dependent, tamoxifen-sensitive cell line with only wild-type p53. The presence of transfected mutant p53 cDNA was verified by the PCR, and overexpression of p53 protein was assessed by Western blotting. Five separate mutant-transfected clones were selected and tested in subsequent growth experiments. In monolayer culture,  there was no consistent evidence of estrogen-independent growth or tamoxifen resistance in the mutant transfectants compared with vector-only controls or the  parental cell line. In soft agar growth experiments, four of five mutant transfectants remained sensitive to tamoxifen in a dose-dependent manner. In the  presence of wild-type p53, mutant 179 p53 protein does not result in estrogen-independent growth or tamoxifen resistance. These results do not exclude the possibility that other p53 mutational types could result in tamoxifen resistance, or that loss of the remaining wild-type allele may be necessary to result in this phenotype.
