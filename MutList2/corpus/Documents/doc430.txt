12829659	Promoter polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha (G-308A) and IL-6 (C-174G) genes predict the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes: the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.	High levels of cytokines are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we investigated whether the promoter polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; G-308A) and interleukin 6 (IL-6; C-174G) genes predict the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study. Altogether, 490 overweight subjects with IGT whose DNA was available were randomly divided into one of the two treatment assignments: the control group and the intensive, individualized diet and exercise intervention group. The -308A allele of the TNF-alpha gene was associated with an approximate twofold higher risk for type 2 diabetes compared with the G-308G genotype (odds ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.05-3.09; P = 0.034). Subjects with both the A allele of the TNF-alpha gene and the C-174C genotype of the IL-6 gene had a 2.2-fold (CI 1.02-4.85, P = 0.045) higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than subjects without the risk genotypes. We conclude that the -308A allele of the promoter polymorphism (G-308A) of the TNF-alpha gene is a predictor for the conversion from IGT to type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, this polymorphism seems to have a gene-gene interaction with the C-174C genotype of the IL-6 gene.
