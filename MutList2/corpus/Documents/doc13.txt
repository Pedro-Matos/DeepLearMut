17919354	Remission of porphyria cutanea tarda after anastrozole treatment of breast cancer.	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is sometimes precipitated or aggravated by increased exposure to estrogen, estrogen-like compounds, or tamoxifen. We report  the case of a 37-year-old white woman who developed sporadic PCT after she took oral contraceptives for 10 years. She was heterozygous for the common H63D mutation of the hemochromatosis-associated HFE gene. The PCT responded partially  to the cessation of oral contraceptives and to phlebotomy therapy to maintain low iron stores, but only remitted after she received anastrozole therapy for management of adenocarcinoma of the breast at age 59 years. The pertinence of HFE mutations, anastrozole and tamoxifen treatment, and chemotherapy to the development and management of PCT in women with breast cancer is discussed.
