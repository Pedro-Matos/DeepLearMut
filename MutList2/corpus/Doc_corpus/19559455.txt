A combination of defective DNA and protective host factors are found in a set of HIV-1 ancestral LTNPs.
We studied viral evolution in three HIV-1 ancestral patients from a group of LTNPs; although some minor sequences showing viral evolution were detected in all patients, the extremely low viral evolution of their viruses was shown by the phylogenetic analysis of the env sequences.
Complete nucleotide sequencing of viral DNA showed the major presence of deletions.
In two patients, deletions of 1088 and 228 nucleotides mapped to 5' LTR-gag region; in the other, a 247 nucleotide deletion was positioned in pol gene up to the vif ORF.
These deleted genomes became dominant during follow up.
Patient's viruses displayed 13 common mutations in conserved residues, from the 5' LTR to the nef gene.
These mutations provided evidence of a common origin.
Regarding host characteristics, one patient had HLA B2705/B5801; another B1402/B5701; whereas a third showed B3901/B4402 and was Delta32-CCR5 heterozygous.
These HIV controllers presented a combination of deleted viral genomes and host protective factors..
