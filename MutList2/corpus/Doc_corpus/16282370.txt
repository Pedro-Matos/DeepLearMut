Stress kinase signaling regulates androgen receptor phosphorylation, transcription, and localization
Activation of signal transduction kinase cascades is known to alter androgen receptor (AR) activity, but the molecular mechanisms are still poorly defined
Here we show that stress kinase signaling regulates Ser 650 phosphorylation and AR nuclear export
In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, activation of either MAPK kinase (MKK) 4:c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or MKK6:p38 signaling pathways increased Ser 650 phosphorylation, whereas pharmacologic inhibition of JNK or p38 signaling led to a reduction of AR Ser 650 phosphorylation
Both p38alpha and JNK1 phosphorylated Ser 650 in vitro
Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either MKK4 or MKK6 increased endogenous prostate-specific antigen (PSA) transcript levels, and this increase was blocked by either bicalutamide or AR small interfering RNA
Stress kinase inhibition of PSA transcription is, therefore, dependent on the AR
Similar experiments involving either activation or inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase:ERK signaling had little effect on Ser 650 phosphorylation or PSA mRNA levels
Ser 650 is proximal to the DNA binding domain that contains a nuclear export signal
Mutation of Ser 650 to alanine reduced nuclear export of the AR, whereas mutation of Ser 650 to the phosphomimetic amino acid aspartate restored AR nuclear export
Pharmacologic inhibition of stress kinase signaling reduced wild-type AR nuclear export equivalent to the S650A mutant without affecting nuclear export of the S650D mutant
Our data suggest that stress kinase signaling and nuclear export regulate AR transcriptional activity.
