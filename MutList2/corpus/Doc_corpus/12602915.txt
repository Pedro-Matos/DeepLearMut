Androgen receptor gene alterations in Finnish male breast cancer.
Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene have been suggested to predispose to male breast cancer (MBC).
Studies on MBC patients have not been based on the mutation screening of the entire coding region of the AR and the number of subjects has been small.
Therefore, some AR gene alterations may have remained undetected.
In the present study, we have comprehensively screened the entire coding region of the AR gene for mutations and also studied the role of AR CAG and GGC repeat lengths as risk factors for MBC in a cohort of 32 Finnish MBC patients.
To estimate the possible involvement of the prostate cancer predisposing AR Arg726Leu germ-line mutation in MBC, this mutation was tested in  117 MBC patients.
No germ-line mutations were found and the CAG and GGC repeat lengths were similar among MBC cases as among Scandinavian population.
Our data indicate that the AR gene does not substantially contribute to MBC predisposition..
