Identification of novel mutations and sequence variants in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia
PURPOSE: Mutations in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes have been reported in patients with anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia
In this study, we evaluated 34 anophthalmic/microphthalmic patient DNA samples (two sets of siblings included) for mutations and sequence variants in SOX2 and CHX10
METHODS: Conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for the initial SOX2 and CHX10 screening of 34 affected individuals (two sets of siblings), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls
Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis
Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by sequencing bidirectionally in patient samples
RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one known) in SOX2 were identified in this cohort
Mutation c.310 G>T (p
Glu104X), found in one patient, was in the region encoding the high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain and resulted in a change from glutamic acid to a stop codon
The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p
Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence
The shortened protein products may result in the loss of function
In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G>A was identified in the 3'-untranslated region in one patient
The relationship between the nucleotide change and the protein function is indeterminate
A known single nucleotide polymorphism (c
*469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 of the 34 patients
Screening of CHX10 identified two synonymous sequence variants, c.471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and c.579 G>A (p
Gln193Gln, novel SNP), and one non-synonymous sequence variant, c.871 G>A (p
Asp291Asn, novel SNP)
The non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in healthy controls, suggesting non-causality
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of SOX2 in ocular development
Loss of SOX2 function results in severe eye malformation
CHX10 was not implicated with microphthalmia/anophthalmia in our patient cohort.
