HFE H63D mutation frequency shows an increase in Turkish women with breast cancer
BACKGROUND: The hereditary hemochromatosis gene HFE plays a pivotal role in iron  homeostasis
The association between cancer and HFE hetero- or homozygosity has previously been shown including hepatocellular and nonhepatocellular malignancies
This study was performed to compare frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D variants in Turkish women with breast cancer and healthy controls
METHODS: Archived DNA samples of Hacettepe University Oncology Institute were used in this study
The HFE gene was investigated by PCR-RFLP
RESULTS: All subjects studied were free from C282Y mutation
Thirty-nine patients had H63D mutation and were all heterozygous
H63D allele frequency was 22.2% (39/176) in the breast cancer patients, and 14% (28/200) in the healthy volunteers
Statistical analysis of cases with HFE H63D phenotype showed significant difference between breast cancer and healthy volunteers (P = 0.02)
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HFE H63D mutation frequencies were increased in the breast cancer patients in comparison to those in the general population
Also, odds ratios (odds ratio = 2.05) computed in this study suggest that H63D has a positive association with breast cancer.
