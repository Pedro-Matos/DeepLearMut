C10ORF97 is a novel tumor-suppressor gene of non-small-cell lung cancer and a functional variant of this gene increases the risk of non-small-cell lung cancer
In an earlier study we showed that C10ORF97 (chromosome-10, open reading frame-97) was expressed in almost all of the tissues and cell lines tested, and that it inhibited the growth of seven tumor cell lines, including two lung carcinoma cell lines (A549 and PG)
Here, we show that C10ORF97 is downregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue compared with normal lung tissue
Overexpression of C10ORF97 significantly suppressed human lung carcinoma A549 cell growth (proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar) and motility (migration and adhesion)
This tumor-suppressive function of C10ORF97 was also verified in vivo
We further found that C10ORF97 caused G(1) arrest of A549 cells and modulated the expression level of several cell-cycle regulators (such as CDK2, cyclin-E and p27)
These effects of C10ORF97 were mediated by physical association between C10ORF97 and Jun-activating domain-binding protein-1 (JAB1), and blocking of JAB1-mediated translocation of p27 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
Together, these results indicated that C10ORF97 functions as a novel tumor suppressor by modulating several key G(1)/S-regulatory proteins by interacting with JAB1
These findings led us to hypothesize that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the C10ORF97 gene that affects its expression might be associated with susceptibility to NSCLC
SNP216 C>T (rs2297882) in the C10ORF97 Kozak sequence was identified, and allele T of SNP216 suppressed C10ORF97 expression in vitro and in vivo
Furthermore, the TT genotype of SNP216 was associated with an increased risk of NSCLC (adjusted odds ratio=1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.33-2.25), P=4.6   10(-5))
These data indicated that C10ORF97 is a tumor suppressor of NSCLC progression and C10ORF97-SNP216 may serve as a predictor of NSCLC.
