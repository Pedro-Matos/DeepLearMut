RPGR ORF15 genotype and clinical variability of retinal degeneration in an Australian population.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) are estimated to cause up to 20% of all Caucasian retinitis pigmentosa and up to 75% of cases of X-Linked RP (XLRP).
Exon open reading frame 15 (ORF15) is a purine-rich mutation hotspot.
Mutations in RPGR ORF15 have also been documented to cause X linked cone-rod dystrophy (XLCORD) and atrophic macular degeneration at an unknown frequency.
METHODS: From a hospital clinic population, probands with probable XLRP and XLCORD were screened for RPGR ORF15 mutations and fully phenotyped.
RESULTS: Four different RPGR ORF15 mutations were found in four probands.
All mutations in the ORF15 exon resulted in premature truncation of the RPGR protein.
Three were nonsense mutations: c.507G>T (p.E169stop), c.867G>T (p.G289stop), c.897G>T (p.E299stop) and the fourth a single nucleotide insertion c.1558-1559insA (p.S522fs 525stop).
One family exhibited typical XLRP, two XLCORD and one a combination of the phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: RPGR ORF15 mutations produce intrafamilial and interfamilial clinical variability with varying degrees of cone degeneration.
In an Australian clinic population RPGR ORF15 mutations cause XLCORD in addition to XLRP..
