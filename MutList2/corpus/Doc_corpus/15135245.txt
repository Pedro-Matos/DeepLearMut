A new but frequent mutation of apoB-100-apoB His3543Tyr
ApolipoproteinB 100 (apoB-100) is an important component of atherogenic lipoproteins such as LDL and serves as a ligand for the LDL-receptor
Familial defective apolipoproteinB 100 (FDB) is caused by a R3500Q mutation of the apoB gene and results in decreased binding of LDL to the LDL-receptor
So far FDB is the most frequent and best studied alteration of apoB-100
Apart from this, three other apoB mutations, R3500W, R3531C and R3480W, affecting binding to the LDL-receptor are known to date
We screened the apoB gene segment of codons 3448-3561 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis in a total of 853 consecutively sampled German patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography for suspected CAD
By this, a new single base mutation was detected and confirmed by DNA sequencing
The mutation, CAC(3543)TAC results in a His3543Tyr substitution in apoB-100 (H3543Y)
The prevalence of heterozygotes for H3543Y in the study population was 0.47% compared to 0.12% for the known Arg 3500 Gln (R3500Q) mutation
In conclusion, the new mutation is four times more frequent than "classical" FDB and thus appears to be the most common apoB mutation in Germany.
