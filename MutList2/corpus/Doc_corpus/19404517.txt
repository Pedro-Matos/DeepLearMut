A large Swiss family with Bernard-Soulier syndrome - Correlation phenotype and genotype
Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopathy and giant platelets
BSS is caused by genetic alterations of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib/V/IX complex
We report on a large Swiss family of whom four family members suffer from BSS
Here, a homozygous missense mutation in position 1829 (A(R)G) of the GPIX gene constituting a N45S substitution is the cause for the bleeding symptoms
A total of 38 family members within two generations were analyzed regarding the N45S mutation by DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism
The laboratory parameters which are characteristically for BSS such as platelet count, platelet volume and the expression of CD42a (GPIX), CD42b (GPIbalpha) and CD41 (GPIIb) were measured for all 38 individuals
The four homozygous patients showed bleeding symptoms, thrombocytopenia and giant platelets
In these patients, the expression of CD42a (GPIX), CD42b (GPIbalpha) was diminished
Interestingly, the intensity of the bleeding symptoms of the 4 homozygous family members seemed to vary although they carry the same mutation
The 24 heterozygous carriers did not differ significantly from their 10 wildtype family members regarding bleeding symptoms and laboratory analysis.
