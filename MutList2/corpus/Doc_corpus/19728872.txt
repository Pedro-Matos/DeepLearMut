A MANBA mutation resulting in residual beta-mannosidase activity associated with severe leukoencephalopathy: a possible pseudodeficiency variant
BACKGROUND: beta-Mannosidosis (OMIM 248510) is a rare inborn lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficient activity of beta-mannosidase, an enzyme encoded by a single gene (MANBA) located on chromosome 4q22-25
To date, only 20 cases of this autosomal recessive disorder have been described and 14 different MANBA mutations were incriminated in the disease
These are all null mutations or missense mutations that abolish beta-mannosidase activity
In this study, we characterized the molecular defect of a new case of beta-mannosidosis, presenting with a severe neurological disorder
METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient to allow MANBA sequencing
The identified mutation was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutant protein was expressed through transient transfection in HEK293T cells
The beta-mannosidase expression and activity were respectively assessed by Western blot and fluorometric assay in both leukocytes and HEK293T cells
RESULTS: A missense disease-associated mutation, c.1922G>A (p.Arg641His), was identified for which the patient was homozygous
In contrast to previously described missense mutations, this substitution does not totally abrogate the enzyme activity but led to a residual activity of about 7% in the patient's leukocytes, 11% in lymphoblasts and 14% in plasma
Expression studies in transfected cells also resulted in 7% residual activity
CONCLUSION: Correlations between MANBA mutations, residual activity of beta-mannosidase and the severity of the ensuing neurological disorder are discussed
Whether the c.1922G>A mutation is responsible for a yet undescribed pseudodeficiency of beta-mannosidase is also discussed.
