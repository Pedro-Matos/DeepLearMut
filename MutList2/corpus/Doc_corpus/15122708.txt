Desmin-related myopathy with Mallory body-like inclusions is caused by mutations of the selenoprotein N gene
Desmin-related myopathies (DRMs) are a heterogeneous group of muscle disorders, morphologically defined by intrasarcoplasmic aggregates of desmin
Mutations in the desmin and the alpha-B crystallin genes account for approximately one third of the DRM cases
The genetic basis of the other forms remain unknown, including the early-onset, recessive form with Mallory body-like inclusions (MB-DRMs), first described in five related German patients
Recently, we identified the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1) as responsible for SEPN-related myopathy (SEPN-RM), a unique early-onset myopathy formerly divided in two different nosological categories: rigid spine muscular dystrophy and the severe form of classical multiminicore disease
The finding of Mallory body-like inclusions in two cases of genetically documented SEPN-RM led us to suspect a relationship between MB-DRM and SEPN1
In the original MB-DRM German family, we demonstrated a linkage of the disease to the SEPN1 locus (1p36), and subsequently a homozygous SEPN1 deletion (del 92 nucleotide -19/+73) in the affected patients
A comparative reevaluation showed that MB-DRM and SEPN-RM share identical clinical features
Therefore, we propose that MB-DRM should be categorized as SEPN-RM
These findings substantiate the molecular heterogeneity of DRM, expand the morphological spectrum of SEPN-RM, and implicate a necessary reassessment of the nosological boundaries in early-onset myopathies.
