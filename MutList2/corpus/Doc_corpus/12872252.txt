Mutational analysis of the BRCA1-interacting genes ZNF350/ZBRK1 and BRIP1/BACH1 among BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative probands from breast-ovarian cancer families and among early-onset breast cancer cases and reference individuals
Two potential breast cancer susceptibility genes, encoding the BRCA1-interacting  proteins ZNF350 (or ZBRK1) and BRIP1 (or BACH1), have been identified in yeast two-hybrid screens
We sequenced these genes in probands from 21 families with potentially inherited breast/ovarian cancer, all of which were negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations
Families had at least one case of male breast cancer, two  cases of ovarian cancer, or three or more cases of breast and ovarian cancer
In  addition, 58 early-onset (before age 35) breast cancer cases and 30 reference individuals were analyzed
Of 17 variants detected in ZBRK1, a missense mutation  Val524Ile was identified in the proband of one high-risk family, but no other family members were available for testing
Of 25 variants identified in BRIP1, in addition to four common silent or missense mutations, we identified Gln540Leu, a  non-conservative amino acid change, in a single familial proband with inflammatory breast cancer, but this mutation was not present in her three relatives with breast cancer
Haplotype analysis suggests that all ZBRK1 SNPs fall within a single block with two SNPs capturing 92% of the haplotype diversity, while the BRIP1 SNPs fall in two blocks, with five SNPs capturing 89%  of the haplotype diversity
Based on sequencing of ZBRK1 and BRIP1 in 21 BRCA1/2-negative probands from inherited breast/ovarian cancer families, it appears unlikely that mutations in these genes account for a significant fraction of inherited breast cancer
Further analysis in unselected cases will be required to know whether the identified variants play a role in genetic predisposition to  breast cancer in the general population
