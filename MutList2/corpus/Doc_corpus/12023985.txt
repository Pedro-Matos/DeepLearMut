A potential role for the XRCC2 R188H polymorphic site in DNA-damage repair and breast cancer.
An acquired genetic instability, resulting from the loss of some types of DNA repair, is an early event in the development of a subset of human cancers.
The involvement of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of double-strand breaks in DNA implicates this pathway in the suppression of breast  cancer.
A family of proteins related to human RAD51, including XRCC2, are essential components of this repair pathway.
Using site-directed mutagenesis of XRCC2, we show that non-conservative substitution or deletion of amino acid 188 of XRCC2 can significantly affect cellular sensitivity to DNA damage, and that a  polymorphic variant at this site (R188H ), present on 6% of chromosomes in the population, has a weak effect on damage sensitivity.
We tested the hypothesis that the R188H polymorphism could be a low-penetrance susceptibility factor for breast cancer, by genotyping 521 women with breast cancer and a total of 895 control women.
Carriage of the rare allele of XRCC2 R188H was associated with breast cancer overall [odds ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=(1.0, 1.8)] and when younger-onset cases with a positive family history were compared with older controls with no family history [odds ratio 1.9; 95% CI=(1.0, 3.8)].
These  results support the hypothesis that subtle variation in DNA repair capacity may influence cancer susceptibility in the population..
