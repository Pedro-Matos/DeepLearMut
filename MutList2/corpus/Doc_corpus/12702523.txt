Prognostic value of p53 molecular status in high-risk primary breast cancer.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in the p53 gene are the most common genetic alterations in  human primary breast carcinoma and these mutations are often associated with worse prognosis and chemo/radioresistance.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis of the p53 gene was performed by fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis in 13 consecutive high-risk primary breast cancer (HR-BC) patients with 10 or more involved axillary nodes to evaluate its prognostic value.
RESULTS: Three p53 mutations (23%) and four allelic variants were detected.
After a median follow-up of 52 months the HR-BC disease-free survival (DFS) was 51% and overall survival 79%.
All patients harboring a p53 mutation (p53(mut)) relapsed within 10 months of the median DFS while 67% of those showing a wild-type p53 status (p53(wt)) survive disease-free at a median follow-up of 43 months.
One p53(mut) patient is still alive while all the p53(wt) patients survive at 56 months median follow-up.
Two out of the four p53(wt) relapsing breast cancer patients showed the Arg72Pro allelic variant; one of these died at 75 months.
CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations may help identify a subset of very high risk breast cancer patients (vHR-BC) with worse prognosis..
