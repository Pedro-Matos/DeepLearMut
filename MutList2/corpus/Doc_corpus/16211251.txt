A novel single-nucleotide substitution, Glu 4 Lys, in the leukotriene C4 synthase gene associated with allergic diseases
Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) play important roles in bronchial asthma, and can mediate bronchial smooth muscle constriction and increase mucous secretion, vascular permeability and cellular infiltration
We identified a novel heterozygous single-nucleotide substitution 10G>A (Glu 4 Lys) in the first exon of the leukotriene C4 synthase gene (LTC4S)
This substitution was detected in 5 of 141 allergic patients, but not in 110 nonallergic subjects
There was a difference in the Glu 4 Lys frequency between the allergic patients and nonallergic subjects (Fisher's exact test, p=0.0460)
The five patients with Glu 4 Lys had allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma and/or allergic dermatitis
Furthermore, a familial analysis of Glu 4 Lys revealed a link with allergic diseases
Thus, our results suggest that Glu 4 Lys in the LTC4S might be associated with allergic diseases.
