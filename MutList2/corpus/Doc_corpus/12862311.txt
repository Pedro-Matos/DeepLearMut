Detection of PHKA2 gene mutation in four Japanese patients with hepatic phosphorylase kinase deficiency
We analyzed the PHKA2 gene in four Japanese families with hepatic phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency
Mutational analysis of PHKA2 cDNA was performed by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing, and each mutation was confirmed on the genomic DNA
In boys with low erythrocyte PhK activity (i.e., x-linked liver glycogenosis [XLG] type I), deletion of exon 2 (splice site mutation of 79-1 G > T) or nonsense mutation of Q1169X or R497X was identified
However, missense mutation of R295C was identified in one boy with normal erythrocyte PhK activity (i.e., XLG type II)
This mutation was not found in 100 control alleles, and was considered responsible for presentation of the XLG type II phenotype
Excluding Q1169X, all mutations detected in this study represented novel mutations
All mothers were found to be heterozygous carriers of the mutations
Gene analysis was confirmed to represent a useful procedure for diagnosing XLG type II, for which liver biopsy had previously been required to detect hepatic PhK deficiency.
