BRCA1 promoter deletions in young women with breast cancer and a strong family history: a population-based study
Women diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40 years who have a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer were selected from an Australian population-based case-control-family study for large deletion screening within the BRCA1 promoter
Deletions within the BRCA1 promoter region are usually not detected by the methods applied in routine clinical mutation detection strategies
Fifty-one of the 66 women (77%) who met our inclusion criteria were tested for promoter deletions using linkage disequilibrium analysis of two BRCA1  polymorphic sites (C/G1802 and Pro871Leu) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification
Two cases of BRCA1 promoter deletion involving exons 1A-2 and exons 1A-23 were detected
The morphology of the breast cancers arising in these  women with BRCA1 promoter deletions was consistent with the morphology associated with other germline BRCA1 mutations
Large genomic deletions that involve the promoter regions of BRCA1 make up 20% (2/10) of all known BRCA1 mutations in this group of young women with a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer
Our data support the inclusion of testing for large genomic alterations in the BRCA1 promoter region in routine clinical mutation detection within BRCA1.
