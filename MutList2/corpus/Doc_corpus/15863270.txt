The missense mutations in the candidate prostate cancer gene ELAC2 do not alter enzymatic properties of its product.
The candidate prostate cancer gene ELAC2 encodes tRNA 3' processing endoribonuclease (tRNase ZL).
We produced recombinant human tRNase ZL's, which contain one to three amino-acid substitutions from three missense mutations (Ser217Leu, Ala541Thr, and Arg781His) that are associated with the occurrence of  prostate cancer.
These enzymes were examined for the pre-tRNA cleavage and the RNase 65 activity.
We did not observe any differences in enzymatic properties such as Km and k(cat) values between the wild-type tRNase ZL and its variants.
We conclude that there is no causality between the enzymatic properties of tRNase ZL and the prostate cancer..
