Mutations and polymorphisms of the p21B transcript in breast cancer
p21(WAF1/CIP1), transcribed from the CDKN1A locus, plays a key role executing p53-induced growth arrest
The recent discovery that an alternative transcript, p21B, induces apoptosis, suggests an additional important function of this gene
 Here, we report p21 and p21B mutation status in large cohorts of breast cancers and compare distributions of p21B polymorphisms in cancer patients to healthy controls
In 521 breast tumor samples analyzed, only one point mutation affecting the p21B protein was observed
No mutations were found when screening a panel of  20 established cell lines
A novel polymorphism, p21B(G128T) was identified
Haplotype analysis revealed no association between this variant and the previously identified p21B polymorphism p21B(T35C) or any of the known p21(WAF1/CIP1) polymorphisms
As previously reported for p21B(T35C), distribution of p21B(G128T) was similar among breast cancer patients and healthy controls (n = 691 and 1,015; incidence 6.1 vs
4.8%; p = 0.273, respectively)
No association between p21B(G128T) or p21B(T35C) and response to chemotherapy with an anthracycline-containing regimen or paclitaxel was recorded
Our findings do not  suggest mutations or polymorphisms of p21B to play a major role with respect to either breast cancer risk or sensitivity towards chemotherapy.
