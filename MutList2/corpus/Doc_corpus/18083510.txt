Characterization of HSD17B1 sequence variants in breast cancer cases from French  Canadian families with high risk of breast and ovarian cancer
A family history of disease and estrogen exposure are risk factors for breast cancer
The HSD17B1 gene encodes a key steroidogenic enzyme that catalyses the final step of estradiol biosynthesis, rendering it a good candidate gene for breast cancer susceptibility
The current study was designed to screen for HSD17B1 germline mutations potentially involved in breast cancer susceptibility
 DNA samples from 50 individuals affected with breast cancer from non-BRCA1/2 French Canadian families with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer were screened for sequence variants in HSD17B1
Our study identified 28 sequence variants, including three non-synonymous variants, p.Ala238Val, p.Arg259His, p.Ser313Gly, one of which (p.Arg259His) was not previously reported
Functional assays failed to show changes in either activity or recombinant proteins levels for all three variants
Thus, our resequencing analysis does not support the existence of deleterious, gain-of-function or transcription mutations in HSD17B1, which could explain the clustering of breast cancer cases in non-BRCA1/2 high-risk French Canadian families
However, a haplotype-based approach was used  to establish tSNPs, providing a valuable tool for further searches of common disease-associated variants in this gene, using large cohorts.
