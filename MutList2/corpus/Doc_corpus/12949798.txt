Ser217Leu polymorphism of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene associated with prostatic cancer risk in Japanese men
The HPC2/ELAC2 gene may be associated with hereditary/familial prostate cancer (PCa)
Two common missense variants (Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr) have been reported  in the gene
We performed mutational, allelotyping and expression analyses and a  molecular epidemiological study to clarify the relations between this gene and prostatic diseases, including PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in Japanese men
We screened for mutations in 109 patients with PCa including 11 patients from 1 hereditary and 9 familial PCa
Loss of heterozygosity and expression were analyzed
An epidemiological study was done in sporadic PCa (n=98) and BPH (n=143) using 1 novel (Ser627Leu) and 2 previously described polymorphisms of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene
Somatic or germline mutations were not confirmed in any cases of PCa
Loss of heterozygosity at 2 microsatellites, D17S1289 and D17S520, was detected in 1 of 38 and 1 of 35 cases, respectively
Expression analysis revealed decreased or absent mRNA expression in 6 of 38 tumors
Epidemiologic analysis showed that a Leu allele at codon 217 was significantly more frequent in patients with PCa than in controls (10.2% vs
3.5%, odds ratio = 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-7.90)
At codon 541, all patients with PCa or BPH and all control subjects had the Ala/Ala genotype
At codon 627, the incidence of the Leu variant was slightly, but not significantly,  higher in patients with BPH than in controls (7.0% vs
2.8%, odds ratio = 2.59, 95% confidence interval, 0.94-7.13, not statistically significant)
We concluded  that germline/somatic mutations of HPC2/ELAC2 are uncommon in PCa
Similarly, allelic imbalances at the gene locus and changes in expression are rare
Although no difference in allele frequency at Ser217Leu between patients with PCa and controls has been reported in a Western population, this polymorphism is a potential indicator of PCa risk in Japanese men and it should be examined in other ethnic groups.
