TP53 mutation and haplotype analysis of two large African American families
Two large apparently unrelated African American families with a high incidence of breast cancer and other tumors characteristic of Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome were studied
Mutation screening revealed that in both families the affected members carried a germline mutation of the TP53 gene at codon 133 (ATG--> ACG, M133T)
In order to determine whether an ancestral haplotype was shared by these two families, polymorphic markers within and flanking the TP53 gene were studied
Haplotype analysis using five markers revealed an identical haplotype shared by the two families
Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus in the probands' tumor tissues from each family  was observed; in each case, the retained allele carried the common haplotype
The frequency of this haplotype in the general African American population is <0.003
This unique haplotype, combined with the rare TP53 mutation, suggests that these  African American families share a common ancestry
This finding suggests that other African Americans may be carriers of this mutation and thus may be at risk  of early-onset breast cancer or other cancers characteristic of the Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome
The finding of recurring mutations in African Americans may facilitate carrier screening and identification in this population.
