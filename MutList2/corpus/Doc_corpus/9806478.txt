Screening for tumour suppressor p16(CDKN2A) germline mutations in Israeli melanoma families.
Approximately ten percent of patients with malignant melanoma have family histories of the disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition.
Germline mutations in tumour suppressor p16 gene have been implicated as disease causing mutations in some of the melanoma families.
The frequency of families with p16 germline mutations among melanoma prone families varies from eight to fifty percent.
The range of the variability is influenced apparently by the number of melanoma affected individuals within the family, as well as by other, yet unidentified factors.
Ethnic background is known to determine both the frequency and the nature of germline alterations.
Recently, specific mutations in tumour suppressor genes involved in breast cancer and in colon cancer were found at elevated frequency among Ashkenazi Jews.
This report describes results of a screening for  p16 germline alterations in a collection of Israeli melanoma families.
We have analyzed genomic DNA from thirty one Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jewish melanoma  families, as well as from thirty melanoma patients without an apparent family history of the disease.
The entire coding region of the p16 gene was screened by  single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing.
We have detected a number of carriers with the Ala148 Thr polymorphism at the end of the second exon and several instances of 500(G=>C) substitution at the 3' untranslated portion of the gene..
