Severe form of thyroid hormone resistance in a patient with homozygous/hemizygous mutation of T3 receptor gene
Resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (RTH) is a rare disorder, usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait
Patients with RTH are usually euthyroid but can occasionally present with signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or rarely with hypothyroidism
Affected individuals are usually heterozygous for mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene (TR-beta)
We present a patient with RTH found to be homo-/hemizygous for a mutation in the TR-beta gene
The single nucleotide substitution I280S (1123T-->G) was present either on both alleles or in a hemizygous form with complete deletion of the second allele
The I280S mutation was recently reported in a heterozygous patient
The severe phenotype with seriously impaired intellectual development, hyperkinetic behaviour, tachycardia, hearing and visual impairment is probably due to the dominant negative effect of the I280S mutant protein and the absence of any functional TR-beta.
