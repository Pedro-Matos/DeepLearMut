Resistance of MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells to TNF-induced cell death is associated with loss of p53 function
We have investigated the relationship between the development of tumor resistance towards the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and p53 function, using the TNF-sensitive MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and  two TNF-resistant sublines, MCF7/R-A1 and MCF7/Adr
Use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing shows that MCF7 has  a wild-type p53 gene, whereas both TNF-resistant sublines exhibit mutant p53
This includes a point mutation R280K in MCF7/R-A1 cells, and a point mutation at  the splicing acceptor site on the upstream border of exon 5 resulting in a 21 pb  deletion in MCF7/Adr cells
These mutations result in loss of p53 capacity to transactivate FASAY (functional assay in yeast)
In contrast to what is observed  for parental MCF7 cells, treatment of resistant sublines with TNF or gamma-irradiation fails neither to induce the expression of the p53-regulated gene products p21waf1/CIP1 and MDM2, nor to arrest the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle
Disruption of p53 wild-type function in MCF7 cells by transfection with human papillomavirus type-16 E6 gene, leads to abrogation of the cytotoxic, but not the cytostatic activity of TNF
Altogether, our results strongly suggest that wild-type p53 is involved in cytotoxic action of TNF, and point out that loss of p53 function contributes to resistance of tumor cell to TNF-induced killing.
