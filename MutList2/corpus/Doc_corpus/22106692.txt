The association between GJB2 mutation and GJB6 gene in non syndromic hearing loss school children
Recently, molecular testing for GJB2 mutations has become the standard of care for the diagnosis of patients with non syndromic hearing impairment of unknown cause
The aims of this study are to determine the association between GJB2 mutation and GJB6 and to report the variation of mutations in deaf students who have heterozygous GJB2
This retrospective study was conducted at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC)
Data was collected from previous files and records from Tissue Engineering and Human Genetic Research Group Laboratory
Approval from Ethical Committee was obtained prior to the study
A total of 138 students have been screened in previous studies in UKMMC for the presence of GJB2 mutations as a cause for hearing loss
Thirty four of the 138 subjects have GJB2 mutations; 2 showed homozygous mutations whereas another 32 were heterozygous for GJB2 gene mutation
Only 31 DNA samples of students presented with sensorineural hearing loss with heterozygous mutation in GJB2 gene were included in this study
The sequencing results obtained were analyzed
The degree of hearing loss of those students with association between GJB2 mutation and GJB6 mutation will be discussed
Five out of 31 subjects (16.2%) have mutations in their GJB6 gene, suggesting a digenic inheritance of GJB2/GJB6 mutation
In total, four novel mutations were identified; E137D (n=1), R32Q (n=1), E101K (n=1) and Y156H (n=1) and one mutation deletion; 366delT (n=1)
All students with association GJB2 mutation and GJB6 showed severe to profound hearing loss in both ears
Interestingly this study not detected the large deletion of 342 kb in GJB6 gene suggesting that the mutation is very rare in this region compared to certain parts of the world.
