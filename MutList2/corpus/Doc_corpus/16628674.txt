A novel multidrug-resistance protein 2 gene mutation identifies a subgroup of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and pruritus
A single nucleotide polymorphism characterized by the substitution of valine for glutamate (V1188E) in exon 25 of the multidrug resistance protein 2 gene was found in a group of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
This heterozygous mutation was significantly associated with the presence of pruritus.
