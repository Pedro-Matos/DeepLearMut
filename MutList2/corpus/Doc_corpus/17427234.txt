Composite adrenal anaplastic neuroblastoma and virilizing adrenocortical tumor with germline TP53 R248W mutation.
Composite tumors are extremely rare.
Such tumors in adrenal glands are usually of neuroendocrine-neural type and occur mostly in adults.
Their pathogenesis remains elusive.
We report a patient with composite neuroblastoma (NB), adrenocortical tumor (ACT), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) with germline TP53 R248W mutation.
LFS predisposes to the development of leukemia, sarcomas, adrenocortical and breast carcinomas, brain tumors and, questionably, NB.
A unique correlation between a single TP53 mutation (R337H) and ACT has been reported in southern Brazilian children.
It remains unclear at this time whether a similar association of NB and R248W in patients with LFS exists..
