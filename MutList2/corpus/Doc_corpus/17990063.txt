Clinical and molecular characterization of Italian patients affected by Cohen syndrome
Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with variability in the clinical manifestations, characterized by developmental delay, visual disability, facial dysmorphisms and intermittent neutropenia
We described a cohort of 10 patients affected by Cohen syndrome from nine Italian families ranging from 5 to 52 years at assessment
Characteristic age related facial changes were well documented
Visual anomalies, namely retinopathy and myopia, were present in 9/10 patients (retinopathy in 9/10 and myopia in 8/10)
Truncal obesity has been described in all patients older than 6 years (8/8)
DNA samples from all patients were analyzed for mutations in COH1 by DHPLC
We detected 15 COH1 alterations most of them were truncating mutations, only one being a missense change
Partial gene deletions have been found in two families
Most mutations were private
Two were already reported in the literature just once
A single base deletion leading to p.T3708fs3769, never reported before, was found in three apparently unrelated families deriving from a restricted area of the Veneto's lowland, between Padova town and Tagliamento river, in heterozygous state
Given the geographical conformation of this region, which is neither geographically or culturally isolated, a recent origin of the mutation could be hypothesized.
