Androgen receptor mutants detected in recurrent prostate cancer exhibit diverse functional characteristics
BACKGROUND: Alterations in the function of androgen receptor (AR) and its signaling pathway may be responsible for the progression of prostate cancer
The  goal of the present study was to investigate the potential roles of AR structural and functional alterations in the progression of prostate cancer, and the relationship between the structure and function of the AR
METHODS: AR gene in 58 prostate cancer samples was examined for mutations using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing
Effects of mutations on the structure and function of AR were investigated by androgen-binding assays and transactivation assays, respectively
RESULTS: Four novel somatic mutations (G142V, D221H, E872Q, and M886I) were identified from recurrent prostate cancer samples
None of the AR mutants differed from wild-type AR (wtAR) in their abilities to bind the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone
However, these mutated AR exhibited diverse functional characteristics as compared with wtAR
G142V and D221H showed increased responses to DHT
E872Q could be abnormally activated by 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, and cyproterone acetate (CPA)
Furthermore, E872Q and M886I presented increased responses to DHT in the presence of coactivators TIF-2 and CBP, but not p300
On  the other hand, although overexpression of corepressors N-CoR and SMRT could result in evident inhibition on DHT- or CPA-induced transactivity of wtAR and the AR mutants, N-CoR displayed stronger inhibitory effects on DHT-induced transactivity of the AR mutants (especially for E872Q and M886I) than that of wtAR
To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of enhanced inhibitory effects of corepressors on the transactivity of the AR mutants found in prostate  cancer
CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here demonstrate that AR mutants found in prostate cancer had different functional alterations, which might play an important role in the progression of prostate cancer.
