Astrocytomas and choroid plexus tumors in two families with identical p53 germline mutations
Germline p53 mutations carry an increased risk of development of breast cancer, soft tissue and osteosarcomas, brain tumors, leukemia and adrenocortical carcinomas
Cerebral neoplasms are usually of astrocytic lineage and occur in 40% of affected families
This report presents clinical, neuropathological and molecular genetic data from 2 families in France with an identical p53 germline mutation in codon 248 (CGG->TGG; Arg->Trp) and a clustering of CNS tumors
The youngest patient in each family developed a malignant choroid plexus tumor while  several young adults of both kindred succumbed to low-grade astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma
The only non-neural neoplasm was an adrenocortical carcinoma in a boy aged 4 years who developed an anaplastic choroid plexus papilloma 2 years later
Of 2 previously reported inherited choroid plexus tumors, 1 occurred in a family which also carried a germline mutation in codon 248
It remains to be shown whether this unusual pattern of CNS tumors is due to an organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or whether it reflects the genetic background of the affected families.
