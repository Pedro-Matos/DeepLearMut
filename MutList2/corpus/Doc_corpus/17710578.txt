Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene polymorphism and its association with preeclampsia in Chinese women
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether polymorphisms of angiotensin converting enzyme gene (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (AT1R) are associated with etiology of preeclampsia and renal impact in women with preeclampsia
METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 133 patients with preeclampsia and 105 healthy pregnant women
The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and the A1166C polymorphism of the AT(1)R gene was additionally assessed by DdeI digestion
The level of proteinuria, fasting serum urea, creatinine and uric acid were investigated according to different genotypes of ACE and AT1R genes
RESULTS: The frequency of genotypes of the ACE gene and the AT1R gene was similar in preeclampsia and normal pregnancy
DD and ID genotype predominated in patients with severe proteinuria, as well as increased serum urea and uric acid
Serum creatinine was also increased, but no significant difference was found among three genotypes
The level of proteinuria, serum uric acid, urea, and creatinine did not vary between different AT1R genotypes
Compared with patients without renal dysfunction, the frequency of DD and ID genotypes of ACE gene was much higher in those with renal dysfunction, but AC and CC genotypes of AT1R gene were not
CONCLUSION: We found no association of the two gene polymorphisms with preeclampsia
However, ACE gene I/D polymorphisms were associated with the severe proteinuria and renal dysfunction seen in preeclampsia
Preeclampsia patients carrying the D allele may be susceptible to renal dysfunction.
