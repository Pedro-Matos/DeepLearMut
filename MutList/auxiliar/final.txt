18565893|t|Risk of cancer by ATM missense mutations in the general population.
18565893|a|PURPOSE: Truncating and missense mutations in the ATM gene, which cause insufficient DNA damage surveillance, allow damaged cells to proceed into mitosis, which eventually results in increased cancer susceptibility. We tested the hypotheses that ATM Ser49Cys and ATM Ser707Pro heterozygosity increase the risk of cancer overall, of breast cancer, and of 26 other cancer subtypes in the  general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 10,324 individuals from the Danish general population who were observed prospectively for 36 years, during which 2,056 developed cancer. RESULTS: Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for ATM Ser49Cys heterozygotes versus noncarriers were 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5) for cancer overall, 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3 to 2.0) for breast cancer, 4.8 (95% CI, 2.2 to 11) for melanoma, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 5.0) for prostate cancer, and 3.4 (95% CI, 1.1 to 11) for cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx. Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for ATM Ser707Pro heterozygotes versus noncarriers were 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.2) for cancer overall, 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2 to 1.6) for breast cancer, 10 (95% CI, 1.1 to 93) for thyroid/other endocrine tumors, and 2.7 (95% CI, 1.0 to 7.6) for cancer of corpus uteri. CONCLUSION: ATM missense mutations do not increase the risk of cancer overall or  of breast cancer in the general population; however, we observed in exploratory analyses that ATM missense mutations may be associated with an increased risk of  other cancer subtypes. As we did multiple comparisons, some of these findings could represent chance findings rather than real phenomena.

18558293|t|A novel mutation of the PTEN gene in a Japanese patient with Cowden syndrome and  bilateral breast cancer.
18558293|a|Cowden syndrome (CS), also known as multiple hamartoma syndrome, is an autosomal  dominant cancer syndrome associated with a high risk of breast and thyroid cancers. The phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) encodes a lipid phosphatase that contains a PTPase domain and a C2 domain and plays a role as a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the cell-survival signaling pathway initiated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PTEN inhibits angiogenesis, and germline mutations of the PTEN gene are associated with CS. We screened for mutations in the PTEN gene in two unrelated Japanese patients with CS. In one patient, who suffered from bilateral breast cancer, thyroid adenoma, and gastric  malignant lymphoma, we found a single-base substitution in exon 2 (115G>C) of the PTEN gene. This transversion results in a germline missense mutation (A39P). To date, nine different mutations have been identified in exon 2 of the PTEN gene in patients with CS and variant CS; however, the A39P missense mutation has not been reported previously. We also detected a previously reported nonsense mutation, 697C>T, resulting in R233X.

18431743|t|Consortium analysis of 7 candidate SNPs for ovarian cancer.
18431743|a|The Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium selected 7 candidate single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs), for which there is evidence from previous studies of an association with variation in ovarian cancer or breast cancer risks. The SNPs selected for analysis were F31I (rs2273535) in AURKA, N372H (rs144848) in BRCA2,  rs2854344 in intron 17 of RB1, rs2811712 5' flanking CDKN2A, rs523349 in the 3' UTR of SRD5A2, D302H (rs1045485) in CASP8 and L10P (rs1982073) in TGFB1. Fourteen studies genotyped 4,624 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 8,113 controls of white non-Hispanic origin. A marginally significant association was found for RB1 when all studies were included [ordinal odds ratio (OR) 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.00) p = 0.041 and dominant OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.98) p = 0.025]; when the studies that originally suggested an association  were excluded, the result was suggestive although no longer statistically significant (ordinal OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.06). This SNP has also been shown to  have an association with decreased risk in breast cancer. There was a suggestion  of an association for AURKA, when one study that caused significant study heterogeneity was excluded [ordinal OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.01-1.20) p = 0.027; dominant OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.24) p = 0.03]. The other 5 SNPs in BRCA2, CDKN2A, SRD5A2, CASP8 and TGFB1 showed no association with ovarian cancer risk; given the large sample size, these results can also be considered to be informative. These  null results for SNPs identified from relatively large initial studies shows the  importance of replicating associations by a consortium approach.

18375489|t|Multiplexed assays for detection of mutations in PIK3CA.
18375489|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PIK3CA gene (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide) have recently been described in a number of cancers, and their detection is currently limited because of the low sensitivity of conventional sequencing techniques. METHODS: We combined Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS; AstraZeneca) allele-specific PCR and Scorpions (DxS) to develop assays for tumor-borne PIK3CA  mutations and used real-time PCR to develop high-throughput multiplexed assays for the most commonly reported PIK3CA mutants (H1047L, H1047R, E542K, E545K). RESULTS: These assays were more sensitive than sequencing and could detect 5 copies of mutant DNA in proportions as low as 0.1% of the total DNA. We assayed DNA extracted from human tumors and detected PIK3CA mutation frequencies of 10.2% in colorectal cancer, 38.7% in breast cancer, 1.9% in lung cancer, and 2.9% in melanoma. In contrast, sequencing detected only 53% of the mutations detected by  our assay. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplexed assays, which can easily be applied to clinical samples, have been developed for the detection of PIK3CA mutations.

18372405|t|Mutation analysis and characterization of HSD17B2 sequence variants in breast cancer cases from French Canadian families with high risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
18372405|a|Estrogen exposure is a risk factor for breast cancer. Given that HSD17B2 gene encodes an enzyme that catalyses estradiol inactivation, it appears as a good candidate breast cancer susceptibility gene. This study was designed to screen for HSD17B2 germline mutations potentially involved in breast cancer predisposition. Our re-sequencing analysis did not identify any deleterious germline mutations, and therefore mutations in HSD17B2 do not explain the clustering of breast cancer cases in non-BRCA1/2 high-risk French Canadian families. However, six sequence variants were identified, including two novel missense variants. Expression assays revealed that p.Ala111Asp and p.Gly160Arg did not alter the catalytic properties of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme, although p.Ala111Asp appears to affect protein stability resulting in significant decreases in the protein levels, providing valuable information on structure-function relationship.

18332865|t|Suppression of PTEN function increases breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug resistance while conferring sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.
18332865|a|Ectopic expression of mutant forms of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) lacking lipid (G129E) or lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase activity decreased sensitivity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which have wild-type PTEN, to doxorubicin and increased sensitivity to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin. Cells transfected with a mutant PTEN gene lacking both lipid and protein phosphatase activities were more resistant to doxorubicin than cells transfected with the PTEN mutant lacking lipid phosphatase activity indicating that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN was also important in controlling the sensitivity to doxorubicin, while no difference was observed between the lipid (G129E) and lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase PTEN mutants in terms of sensitivity to rapamycin. A synergistic inhibitory interaction was observed when doxorubicin was combined with rapamycin  in the phosphatase-deficient PTEN-transfected cells. Interference with the lipid  phosphatase activity of PTEN was sufficient to activate Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. These studies indicate that disruption of the normal activity of the PTEN phosphatase can have dramatic effects on the therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancer cells. Mutations in the key residues which control PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase may act as dominant-negative mutants to suppress endogenous PTEN and alter the sensitivity of breast cancer patients to chemo- and targeted therapies.

18307025|t|A Japanese patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who had nine primary malignancies associated with a germline mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene.
18307025|a|We describe a patient who had nine primary malignant tumors and a germline mutation in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, characteristically found in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). A 15-year-old girl with no family history of cancer was referred to our hospital because of pain and swelling of the right knee. Osteosarcoma was diagnosed. The patient received chemotherapy followed by surgery and had a remission. After the age of 28 years, nine primary malignant tumors developed successively, including right breast cancer, colon cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the abdominal wall, right lung double cancers, bilateral breast cancers, and MFH of the left thigh. This is the second highest number of types of primary malignant tumors to be reported in LFS. All tumors were treated by a multidisciplinary approach, including surgery. Genetic analysis revealed a germline missense mutation in the p53 gene (c.659 A > G), resulting in Y220C, which has been reported in three families with LFS. The patient died of lung metastasis from MFH at the age of 37 years. Despite the multiple tumors, repeated induction of remissions resulted in long survival. Our findings suggest  that a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including surgery, is beneficial  in patients with LFS.

18288683|t|Analysis of the gene coding for the BRCA2-interacting protein PALB2 in hereditary prostate cancer.
18288683|a|BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of susceptibility to prostate cancer (PRCA) remains elusive. Mutations in BRCA2 have been associated with increased prostate cancer risk and account for around 2% of young onset (<56 years) prostate cancer cases.  PALB2 is a recently identified breast cancer susceptibility gene whose protein is closely associated with BRCA2 and is essential for BRCA2 anchorage to nuclear structures. This functional relationship made PALB2 a candidate PRCA susceptibility gene. METHODS: We sequenced PALB2 in probands from 95 PRCA families, 77 of which had two or more cases of early onset PRCA (age at diagnosis <55 years), and the remaining 18 had one case of early onset PRCA and five or more total cases of PRCA. RESULTS: Two previously unreported variants, K18R and V925L were identified, neither of which is in a known PALB2 functional domain and both of which are unlikely to be pathogenic. No truncating mutations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that deleterious PALB2 mutations are unlikely to play a significant role in hereditary prostate cancer.

18241035|t|Breast cancer-associated mutations in metalloprotease disintegrin ADAM12 interfere with the intracellular trafficking and processing of the protein.
18241035|a|ADAM12 has recently emerged as a Candidate Cancer Gene in a comprehensive genetic analysis of human breast cancers. Three somatic mutations in ADAM12 were observed at significant frequencies in breast cancers: D301H, G479E and L792F. The first 2 of these mutations involve highly conserved residues in ADAM12, and our computational sequence analysis confirms that they may be cancer-related. We show that the corresponding mutations in mouse ADAM12 inhibit the proteolytic processing and activation of ADAM12 in NIH3T3, COS-7, CHO-K1 cells and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The D/H and G/E ADAM12 mutants exert a dominant-negative effect on the processing of the wild-type ADAM12. Immunofluorescence analysis and cell surface biotinylation experiments demonstrate that the D/H and G/E mutants are retained inside the cell and are not transported to the cell surface. Consequently, the D/H and G/E mutants, unlike the wild-type ADAM12, are not capable of shedding Delta-like l, a ligand for Notch receptor, at the cell surface, or of stimulating cell migration. Our results suggest that the breast cancer-associated mutations interfere with the intracellular trafficking of ADAM12 and result in loss of the functional ADAM12 at the cell surface.

18193092|t|Epidermal growth factor receptor activation in prostate cancer by three novel missense mutations.
18193092|a|While epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dysregulation is known to play a critical role in prostate carcinogenesis, there has been no direct evidence indicating EGFR mutations induce tumorigenesis in prostate cancer. We previously  identified four novel EGFR somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain of prostate cancer patients: G735S, G796S, E804G and R841K. In this study, we investigated the oncogenic potential of these somatic mutations by establishing stable clonal NIH3T3 cells expressing these four mutations and WT EGFR to determine their ability to increase cell proliferation and invasion. In the absence of the EGF ligand, cell proliferation was readily increased in G735S, G796S and E804G mutants compared to WT EGFR. The addition of EGF ligand greatly increased cell growth and transforming ability of these same EGFR mutants. Matrigel invasion assays showed enhanced invasion with G735S, G796S and E804G mutants. Western blot analysis showed that these EGFR mutations enhanced cell growth and invasion via constitutive and hyperactive tyrosine phosphorylation and led to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Akt pathways. Our findings demonstrate the oncogenic activation of three novel EGFR somatic missense mutations in prostate cancer. Molecules that regulate the mechanisms of  their oncogenic activation represent novel targets for limiting tumor cell progression, and further elucidation of these mutations will have utility in prostate cancer treatment.

18186519|a|Mismatch repair detection (MRD) was used to screen 93 matched tumor-normal sample pairs and 22 cell lines for somatic mutations in 30 cancer relevant genes. Using  a starting amount of only 150 ng of genomic DNA, we screened 102 kb of sequence for somatic mutations in colon and breast cancer. A total of 152 somatic mutations were discovered, encompassing previously reported mutations, such as BRAF V600E and KRAS G12S, G12V, and G13D, as well as novel mutations, including some in genes in which somatic mutations have not previously been reported, such  as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2. The distribution of mutations ranged widely within and across tumor types. The functional significance of many of these mutations is not understood, with patterns of selection only evident in KRAS and BRAF in colon cancer. These results present a novel approach to high-throughput mutation screening using small amounts of starting material and reveal a mutation spectrum across 30 genes in a large cohort of breast and colorectal cancers.

18083510|t|Characterization of HSD17B1 sequence variants in breast cancer cases from French  Canadian families with high risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
18083510|a|A family history of disease and estrogen exposure are risk factors for breast cancer. The HSD17B1 gene encodes a key steroidogenic enzyme that catalyses the final step of estradiol biosynthesis, rendering it a good candidate gene for breast cancer susceptibility. The current study was designed to screen for HSD17B1 germline mutations potentially involved in breast cancer susceptibility.  DNA samples from 50 individuals affected with breast cancer from non-BRCA1/2 French Canadian families with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer were screened for sequence variants in HSD17B1. Our study identified 28 sequence variants, including three non-synonymous variants, p.Ala238Val, p.Arg259His, p.Ser313Gly, one of which (p.Arg259His) was not previously reported. Functional assays failed to show changes in either activity or recombinant proteins levels for all three variants. Thus, our resequencing analysis does not support the existence of deleterious, gain-of-function or transcription mutations in HSD17B1, which could explain the clustering of breast cancer cases in non-BRCA1/2 high-risk French Canadian families. However, a haplotype-based approach was used  to establish tSNPs, providing a valuable tool for further searches of common disease-associated variants in this gene, using large cohorts.

18036263|t|Identification of BRCA1 missense substitutions that confer partial functional activity: potential moderate risk variants?
18036263|a|INTRODUCTION: Many of the DNA sequence variants identified in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 remain unclassified in terms of their potential pathogenicity. Both multifactorial likelihood analysis and functional approaches  have been proposed as a means to elucidate likely clinical significance of such variants, but analysis of the comparative value of these methods for classifying  all sequence variants has been limited. METHODS: We have compared the results from multifactorial likelihood analysis with those from several functional analyses for the four BRCA1 sequence variants  A1708E, G1738R, R1699Q, and A1708V. RESULTS: Our results show that multifactorial likelihood analysis, which incorporates sequence conservation, co-inheritance, segregation, and tumour immunohistochemical analysis, may improve classification of variants. For A1708E, previously shown to be functionally compromised, analysis of oestrogen receptor,  cytokeratin 5/6, and cytokeratin 14 tumour expression data significantly strengthened the prediction of pathogenicity, giving a posterior probability of pathogenicity of 99%. For G1738R, shown to be functionally defective in this study, immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed previous findings of inconsistent  'BRCA1-like' phenotypes for the two tumours studied, and the posterior probability for this variant was 96%. The posterior probabilities of R1699Q and A1708V were 54% and 69%, respectively, only moderately suggestive of increased risk. Interestingly, results from functional analyses suggest that both of these  variants have only partial functional activity. R1699Q was defective in foci formation in response to DNA damage and displayed intermediate transcriptional transactivation activity but showed no evidence for centrosome amplification. In  contrast, A1708V displayed an intermediate transcriptional transactivation activity and a normal foci formation response in response to DNA damage but induced centrosome amplification. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need for a range of functional studies to be performed in order to identify variants with partially compromised function. The  results also raise the possibility that A1708V and R1699Q may be associated with  a low or moderate risk of cancer. While data pooling strategies may provide more  information for multifactorial analysis to improve the interpretation of the clinical significance of these variants, it is likely that the development of current multifactorial likelihood approaches and the consideration of alternative statistical approaches will be needed to determine whether these individually rare variants do confer a low or moderate risk of breast cancer.

17919354|t|Remission of porphyria cutanea tarda after anastrozole treatment of breast cancer.
17919354|a|Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is sometimes precipitated or aggravated by increased exposure to estrogen, estrogen-like compounds, or tamoxifen. We report  the case of a 37-year-old white woman who developed sporadic PCT after she took oral contraceptives for 10 years. She was heterozygous for the common H63D mutation of the hemochromatosis-associated HFE gene. The PCT responded partially  to the cessation of oral contraceptives and to phlebotomy therapy to maintain low iron stores, but only remitted after she received anastrozole therapy for management of adenocarcinoma of the breast at age 59 years. The pertinence of HFE mutations, anastrozole and tamoxifen treatment, and chemotherapy to the development and management of PCT in women with breast cancer is discussed.

17889706|t|Identification of rare variants in the hLIMD1 gene in breast cancer.
17889706|a|The hLIMD1 gene is located at chromosome 3p21 and was identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene using an elimination test assay. Chromosome 3p21 loci are frequently deleted in a number of cancers, including breast. The 3p21.3 locus harbors a number of tumor suppressor candidates, including LIMD1, a member of the ZYXIN family of genes. LIMD1 directly interacts with RB and is thought to play a  role in suppressing tumor growth. To investigate whether mutations in the LIMD1 gene could potentially be involved in breast cancer, we used single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis on DNA from 235 breast cancers and 95 controls. We identified four novel coding region alterations, including two amino acid substitutions at positions 255 and 302. The two remaining novel variants were found at amino acid positions 246 and 647 and encoded silent alterations. The rare Ser255Arg variant was identified in only sporadic breast tumors (2/165 tumors). Some ZYXIN proteins are phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases, and  the Ser255Arg change is located in a region phosphorylated on serine residues. Together, the data suggest that this variant may warrant further characterization.

17848578|t|Structural requirements for the BARD1 tumor suppressor in chromosomal stability and homology-directed DNA repair.
17848578|a|The BRCA1 tumor suppressor exists as a heterodimeric complex with BARD1, and this complex is thought to mediate many of the functions ascribed to BRCA1, including  its role in tumor suppression. The two proteins share a common structural organization that features an N-terminal RING domain and two C-terminal BRCT motifs, whereas BARD1 alone also contains three tandem ankyrin repeats. In normal cells, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is believed to enhance chromosome stability by promoting homology-directed repair (HDR) of double strand DNA breaks. Here we have investigated the structural requirements for BARD1 in this process by complementation of Bard1-null mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Our results demonstrate that the ankyrin and BRCT motifs of BARD1 are each essential for both chromosome stability and HDR. Tandem BRCT motifs, including those found at the C  terminus of BARD1, are known to form a phosphoprotein recognition module. Nonetheless, the HDR function of BARD1 was not perturbed by synthetic mutations predicted to ablate the phospho-recognition activity of its BRCT sequences, suggesting that some functions of the BRCT domains are not dependent on their ability to bind phosphorylated ligands. Also, cancer-associated missense mutations in the BRCT domains of BARD1 (e.g. C557S, Q564H, V695L, and S761N) have been observed in patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial tumors. However,  none of these was found to affect the HDR activity of BARD1, suggesting that any  increased cancer risk conferred by these mutations is not because of defects in this repair mechanism.

17574969|t|Association of the BRCA1 missense variant R1699W with a malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast.
17574969|a|Familial breast carcinomas that are attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have characteristic morphologic and immunhistochemical features. BRCA1-associated carcinomas are poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinomas frequently exhibiting morphologic features of typical or atypical medullary carcinomas such  as prominent lymphocytic infiltrate and pushing margins. We report on a patient carrying the deleterious BRCA1 germline mutation R1699W, who presented with a malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast. The re-investigation of archival material by a reference pathologist of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GCHBOC) revealed BRCA-associated pronounced pushing margins. In a total of 618 unrelated index patients who are registered in the GCHBOC database, no other phyllodes tumor has been described, while 10 carriers of the R1699W mutant have been identified. We conclude that the histopathologic appearance of the phyllodes tumor indicates an association with the BRCA1 mutation R1699W although it is a rare event in BRCA-positive families.

17553133|t|Risk factors for breast cancer characterized by the estrogen receptor alpha A908G (K303R) mutation.
17553133|a|INTRODUCTION: Estrogen is important in the development of breast cancer, and its  biological effects are mediated primarily through the two estrogen receptors alpha and beta. A point mutation in the estrogen receptor alpha gene, ESR1, referred to as A908G or K303R, was originally identified in breast hyperplasias and was reported to be hypersensitive to estrogen. We recently detected this mutation at a low frequency of 6% in invasive breast tumors of the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS). METHODS: In this report, we evaluated risk factors for invasive breast cancer classified according to the presence or absence of the ESR1 A908G mutation in the CBCS, a population-based case-control study of breast cancer among younger and older white and African-American women in North Carolina. Of the 653 breast tumors evaluated, 37 were ESR1 A908G mutation-positive and 616 were mutation-negative. RESULTS: ESR1 A908G mutation-positive breast cancer was significantly associated  with a first-degree family history of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 6.28), whereas mutation-negative breast cancer was not. Comparison of the two case subgroups supported this finding (OR = 2.65,  95% CI = 1.15 to 6.09). There was also the suggestion that longer duration of oral contraceptive (OC) use (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.16 to 12.03; Ptrend = 0.02 for use of more than 10 years) and recent use of OCs (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 0.80 to 16.45; Ptrend = 0.10 for use within 10 years) were associated with ESR1 A908G mutation-positive breast cancer; however, ORs for comparison of the two case subgroups were not statistically significant. Hormone replacement therapy use was inversely correlated with mutation-negative breast cancer, but the effect on mutation-positive cancer was unclear due to the small number of postmenopausal cases whose tumors carried the mutation. Mutation-negative breast cancer was associated with several reproductive factors, including younger age at menarche (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.94) and greater total estimated years of ovarian function (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.21 to 2.74). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that OCs may interact with the ESR1 A908G mutant receptor to drive the development of some breast tumors.

17550384|t|Somatic mutations of BECN1, an autophagy-related gene, in human cancers.
17550384|a|Evasion of programmed cell death (PCD) is one of the hallmarks of human cancers.  It is well known that not only apoptosis, but also autophagy, acts as an action mechanism of PCD. BECN1 protein is a key regulator of autophagic PCD. The BECN1 gene that encodes BECN1 protein acts as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene. However, to date, data on BECN1 mutation in human cancer tissues are lacking. To explore the possibility that somatic mutation of the BECN1 gene might contribute to the development of human cancers, we analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of the human BECN1 gene for detection of somatic mutations in 180 gastric carcinomas, 94 breast carcinomas, 50 acute leukemias, 50 colorectal carcinomas, 50 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 124 non-small cell lung  cancers by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Overall, we detected 11 somatic mutations of the BECN1 gene, including 3 missense mutations (N8K, P350R and R389C) in coding sequences and 8 mutations in introns.  The mutations were observed in five gastric, three colorectal, one lung and one breast carcinoma (s). We expressed the three mutations (N8K, P350R and R389C) in  HT1080 cells, and found that two (P350R and R389C) of them showed only slightly decreased cell death activities compared to the wild-type BECN1. This is the first report on BECN1 gene mutations in human cancer tissues, and the data suggest that point mutations are a rare event in common human cancers and probably do not play a major role in cancer pathogenesis.

17541742|t|Germline TP53 mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative French Canadian breast cancer families.
17541742|a|About 40% of French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families harbor germline BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutations where common mutations account for about 84% of all mutations identified in cancer families. Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G>A (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 G>A mutation was screened in series of 52 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. However, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. To further characterize the contribution of TP53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families. Thirty sequence variants were identified, the  majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of TP53. However, the 14538 G>A (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome. Neither of the TP53 mutations was detected in 381 French Canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. In all, germline TP53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8%) cancer families, suggesting that TP53 is not a major contributor to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent.

17531442|t|Identification of sequences that target BRCA1 to nuclear foci following alkylative DNA damage.
17531442|a|BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor involved in the maintenance of genome integrity. BRCA1 co-localizes with DNA repair proteins at nuclear foci in response to DNA double-strand breaks caused by ionizing radiation (IR). The response of BRCA1 to  agents that elicit DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) is poorly defined. In this study, we compared chemicals that induce SSB repair and observed the most striking nuclear redistribution of BRCA1 following treatment with the alkylating  agent methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS). In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, MMTS induced movement of endogenous BRCA1 into distinctive nuclear foci that co-stained with the SSB repair protein XRCC1, but not the DSB repair protein gamma-H2AX. XRCC1 did not accumulate in foci after ionizing radiation. Moreover,  we showed by deletion mapping that different sequences target BRCA1 to nuclear foci induced by MMTS or by ionizing radiation. We identified two core MMTS-responsive sequences in BRCA1: the N-terminal BARD1-binding domain (aa1-304) and the C-terminal sequence aa1078-1312. These sequences individually are ineffective, but together they facilitated BRCA1 localization at MMTS-induced foci. Site-directed mutagenesis of two SQ/TQ motif serines (S1143A and S1280A) in the BRCA1 fusion protein reduced, but did not abolish, targeting to MMTS-inducible foci. This is the first report to describe co-localization of BRCA1 with XRCC1 at SSB repair foci. Our results indicate that BRCA1 requires BARD1 for targeting to different types of DNA lesion, and that distinct C-terminal sequences mediate selective recruitment to sites of double- or single-strand DNA damage.

17517479|t|Possession of ATM sequence variants as predictor for late normal tissue responses in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.
17517479|a|PURPOSE: The ATM gene product is a central component of cell cycle regulation and genomic surveillance. We hypothesized that DNA sequence alterations in ATM predict for adverse effects after external beam radiotherapy for early breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 131 patients with a minimum of 2 years follow-up who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy were screened for sequence alterations in ATM using DNA from blood lymphocytes. Genetic variants were identified using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late morbidity scoring schemes for skin and subcutaneous tissues were applied to quantify the radiation-induced effects. RESULTS: Of the 131 patients, 51 possessed ATM sequence alterations located within exons or in short intron regions flanking each exon that encompass putative splice site regions. Of these 51 patients, 21 (41%) exhibited a minimum  of a Grade 2 late radiation response. In contrast, of the 80 patients without an  ATM sequence variation, only 18 (23%) had radiation-induced adverse responses, for an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.2). Fifteen patients were heterozygous for the G-->A polymorphism at nucleotide 5557, which causes substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 1853 of the ATM protein. Of these 15 patients, 8 (53%) exhibited a Grade 2-4 late response compared with 31 (27%) of the 116 patients without this alteration, for an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.4). CONCLUSION: Sequence variants located in the ATM gene, in particular the 5557 G-->A polymorphism, may predict for late adverse radiation responses in breast cancer patients.

17502119|t|ATM missense variant P1054R predisposes to prostate cancer.
17502119|a|BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is associated with defective DNA strand break repair  after DNA damage leading to genetic instability and prostate cancer progression.  The ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene product is known to play an important role in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of genomic integrity. We  investigated whether the prevalence of the ATM missense substitution P1054R is increased in a hospital-based series of prostate cancer patients and whether carriers are at increased risk for treatment-related side effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 261 patients treated for early-stage prostate cancer with I-125 brachytherapy (permanent seed implantation) between 10/2000 and 04/2006 at our institution and a comparison group of 460 male control individuals were screened for the presence of the P1054R variant. Outcome of therapy regarding morbidity was assessed prospectively and compared between carriers vs. non-carriers with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), a Quality-of-Life-index (QoL) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) with its subgroups (IIEF-5 and EF). RESULTS: The proportion of carriers of the P1054R variant was significantly higher among prostate cancer patients than in the general population (25 out of 261 vs. 22 out of 460; OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.8, p<0.01). A subgroup of the carriers additionally harboured the ATM missense variant F858L that was associated with a similar risk (OR=2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.6; p=0.03). After a mean follow-up of 18 months there were no statistically significant differences regarding IPSS (p=0.48), QoL (p=0.61), IIEF-15 score (p=0.78), IIEF-5 score (p=0.83), and EF score (p=0.80), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ATM missense variant P1054R confers an about twofold increased risk for prostate cancer in our series. The subgroup of patients with the second-site variant F858L is not at significantly higher risk. After 18 months, there was no evidence for an increased adverse radiotherapy response in P1054R carriers.

17493881|t|Thermal unfolding of human BRCA1 BRCT-domain variants.
17493881|a|Missense mutations at the BRCT domain of human BRCA1 protein have been associated with an elevated risk for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. They have been shown  to affect the binding site and they have also been proposed to affect domain stability, severely hampering the protein's tumor suppressor function. In order to assess the impact of various such mutations upon the stability and the function of the BRCT domain, heat-induced denaturation has been employed to study the thermal unfolding of variants M1775R and R1699W, which have been linked with  the disease, as well as of V1833M, which has been reported for patients with a family history. Calorimetric and circular dichroism results reveal that in pH 9.0, 5 mM borate buffer, 200 mM NaCl, analogously to wild type BRCT, all three variants undergo partial thermal unfolding to a denatured state, which retains most of the native's structural characteristics. With respect to wild-type BRCT,  the mutation M1775R induces the most severe effects especially upon the thermostability, while R1699W also has a strong impact. On the other hand, the thermal unfolding of variant V1833M is only moderately affected relative to wild-type BRCT. Moreover, isothermal titration calorimetric measurements reveal that contrary to M1775R and R1699W variants, V1833M binds to BACH1 and CtIP phosphopeptides.

17487399|t|VEGF transcription and mRNA stability are altered by WT1 not DDS(R384W) expression in LNCaP cells.
17487399|a|To identify physiologically relevant WT1 transcriptional target genes in prostate cancer cells, we have established stably transfected LNCaP cell lines expressing  either WT1(A), its mutant counterpart DDS(R384W), or vector control. Microarray analyses of these cells revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was differentially expressed in the engineered lines. Regulation of VEGF by WT1 likely contributes to kidney angiogenesis during development and WT1 mutants such as DDS(R384W) are associated with the Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), characterized by renal abnormalities. Recent mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the WT1(A) isoform binds VEGF promoter sequences and transcriptionally regulates VEGF reporter constructs. However, regulation of VEGF is complex, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. This study examined the ability of hormone and Actinomycin D treatment to alter VEGF mRNA levels in stably transfected WT-LNCaP, DDS-LNCaP, or V-LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The rationale of this study was based on a previous finding that enhancement of VEGF  expression in DDS-LNCaP cells occurred only in the presence of the androgen analog, R1881. One possible explanation for these results was that DDS-WT1 stabilized VEGF mRNA so that it accumulated to higher levels. This hypothesis was tested by treating engineered LNCaP cells with Actinomycin D (Act D) and then measuring VEGF mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR. The combined effects of WT1 or DDS(R384W) and hormone were tested in these message stability assays and also in transcription assays of transiently transfected LNCaP cells. The results  indicated that DDS-WT1 is unable to regulate VEGF transcription or stabilize VEGF mRNA in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. However our observations are also consistent with wild-type WT1(A) having both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects on VEGF mRNA levels in the presence of hormone. These studies of VEGF regulation by WT1 and dysregulation by DDS(R384W) suggest an important role for WT1 in both normal and tumor-related angiogenesis.

17443496|t|Mutations and polymorphisms of the p21B transcript in breast cancer.
17443496|a|p21(WAF1/CIP1), transcribed from the CDKN1A locus, plays a key role executing p53-induced growth arrest. The recent discovery that an alternative transcript, p21B, induces apoptosis, suggests an additional important function of this gene.  Here, we report p21 and p21B mutation status in large cohorts of breast cancers and compare distributions of p21B polymorphisms in cancer patients to healthy controls. In 521 breast tumor samples analyzed, only one point mutation affecting the p21B protein was observed. No mutations were found when screening a panel of  20 established cell lines. A novel polymorphism, p21B(G128T) was identified. Haplotype analysis revealed no association between this variant and the previously identified p21B polymorphism p21B(T35C) or any of the known p21(WAF1/CIP1) polymorphisms. As previously reported for p21B(T35C), distribution of p21B(G128T) was similar among breast cancer patients and healthy controls (n = 691 and 1,015; incidence 6.1 vs. 4.8%; p = 0.273, respectively). No association between p21B(G128T) or p21B(T35C) and response to chemotherapy with an anthracycline-containing regimen or paclitaxel was recorded. Our findings do not  suggest mutations or polymorphisms of p21B to play a major role with respect to either breast cancer risk or sensitivity towards chemotherapy.

17427234|a|Composite tumors are extremely rare. Such tumors in adrenal glands are usually of neuroendocrine-neural type and occur mostly in adults. Their pathogenesis remains elusive. We report a patient with composite neuroblastoma (NB), adrenocortical tumor (ACT), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) with germline TP53 R248W mutation. LFS predisposes to the development of leukemia, sarcomas, adrenocortical and breast carcinomas, brain tumors and, questionably, NB. A unique correlation between a single TP53 mutation (R337H) and ACT has been reported in southern Brazilian children. It remains unclear at this time whether a similar association of NB and R248W in patients with LFS exists.

17336451|t|Uncoupling of hormone-dependence from chaperone-dependence in the L701H mutation  of the androgen receptor.
17336451|a|The mechanisms underlying androgen receptor (AR)-mediated progression of prostate cancer following androgen ablation have yet to be fully determined. On this basis we screened naturally occurring mutants of human AR for hormone-independent activity using a yeast model system. An initial screen of 43 different mutants revealed that ARs having a Leu701His mutation (AR(L701H)) exhibited hormone-independent activation of a lacZ reporter gene. The AR(L701H) mutant bound dihydrotestosterone to a similar extent as did wild type AR, although its ability to be induced by hormone for transactivation was reduced substantially. Subsequent studies focused on the dependence of AR(L701H) on molecular chaperones for folding to the active state. We found that AR(L701H) was highly dependent on  Hsp90 for its hormone-independent activation, suggesting that this chaperone functions in AR(L701H) folding. However, the mutant did not respond specifically  to increased levels of FKBP52, suggesting that this chaperone functions at the hormone-dependent activation stage in the folding process. Further studies of AR(L701H) in PC3 cells suggested that this mutant is prohibited from hormone-independent transactivation in mammalian cells. However, basal expression of a reporter gene by AR(L701H) was not impaired by the presence of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin as was wild type AR, suggesting differential interactions of these receptors with molecular chaperones in animal  cells.

17317153|t|BRCA1 promoter deletions in young women with breast cancer and a strong family history: a population-based study.
17317153|a|Women diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40 years who have a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer were selected from an Australian population-based case-control-family study for large deletion screening within the BRCA1 promoter. Deletions within the BRCA1 promoter region are usually not detected by the methods applied in routine clinical mutation detection strategies. Fifty-one of the 66 women (77%) who met our inclusion criteria were tested for promoter deletions using linkage disequilibrium analysis of two BRCA1  polymorphic sites (C/G1802 and Pro871Leu) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe  amplification. Two cases of BRCA1 promoter deletion involving exons 1A-2 and exons 1A-23 were detected. The morphology of the breast cancers arising in these  women with BRCA1 promoter deletions was consistent with the morphology associated with other germline BRCA1 mutations. Large genomic deletions that involve the promoter regions of BRCA1 make up 20% (2/10) of all known BRCA1 mutations in this group of young women with a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer. Our data support the inclusion of testing for large genomic alterations in the BRCA1 promoter region in routine clinical mutation detection within BRCA1.

17217814|t|[Prevalence of Val158Met polymorphism in COMT gene on non-BRCA1/2 hereditary breast cancer].
17217814|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of Val158Met polymorphism in Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and its effect on genetic susceptibility for breast cancer in Shanghai population. METHODS: A total of 114 patients with BRCA1/BRCA 2 negative hereditary breast cancer from independent families and 121 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed. Genotype analysis was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and  then DNA direct sequencing. The odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression model. RESULTS: The frequency of Val158Met polymorphism GG, GA and AA genotype in case group and control was 0.58 (65), 0.32 (36), 0.10 (11) and 0.60 (66), 0.35 (41), 0.03 (3), respectively. The frequency of allele-containing genotypes is significantly higher in early-onset breast cancer patients (0.57) than in familial ones (0.35). Compared with GG (Val/Val) genotype, AA (Met/Met) genotype  confers a significantly increased risk for breast cancer (adjusted OR = 3.15; 95% CI, 0.70 - 14.19), especially among premenopausal women (adjusted OR = 9.98; 95%  CI, 1.00 - 99.64). Borderline significantly association was found between AA genotype (adjusted OR = 7.57; 95% CI, 0.57 - 101.28) and susceptibility for breast cancer in BMI < or = 23 kg/m(2) group. CONCLUSIONS: Val158Met polymorphism in COMT gene could be a candidate for low penetrance breast cancer susceptibility in Shanghai population, especially among  premenopausal women and early-onset breast cancer patients.

17130833|t|Negative regulation of chemokine receptor CXCR4 by tumor suppressor p53 in breast cancer cells: implications of p53 mutation or isoform expression on breast cancer cell invasion.
17130833|a|Chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 are suggested to be involved in migration, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Mutation of the tumor  suppressor gene p53 in breast cancer is associated with metastasis and aggressive clinical phenotype. In this report, we demonstrate that wild type but not the dominant-negative mutant (V143A) or cancer-specific mutants (R175H or R280K) of p53 repress CXCR4 expression. Recently described cancer-specific p53 isoform, Delta133p53, also failed to repress CXCR4 promoter activity. Short-interfering RNA-mediated depletion of p53 increased endogenous CXCR4 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that contain wild-type p53. Basal CXCR4 promoter activity in  HCT116 colon carcinoma cells deleted of p53 [HCT116(p53KO)] was 10-fold higher compared to that in parental HCT116 cells with functional wild-type p53. Deletion analysis of CXCR4 promoter identified a seven-base pair p53-repressor element homologous to cyclic AMP/AP-1 response (CRE/AP-1) element. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of ATF-1 and cJun to the CRE/AP-1 element. The p53 rescue drug PRIMA-1 reduced CXCR4 mRNA  and cell surface expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, which express R280K mutant p53.  CP-31398, another p53 rescue drug, similarly reduced cell surface levels of CXCR4. PRIMA-1-mediated decrease in CXCR4 expression correlated with reduced invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through matrigel. These results suggest a mechanism  for elevated CXCR4 expression and metastasis of breast cancers with p53 mutations or isoform expression. We propose that p53 rescue drugs either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs may be effective in reducing CXCR4-mediated metastasis.

17020975|t|RNASEL gene polymorphisms and the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.
17020975|a|PURPOSE: Studies revealing conflicting results on the role of RNASEL polymorphisms Glu265X, Arg462Gln, and Asp541Glu on prostate cancer risk led us to perform a meta-analysis to investigate the association of these polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Relevant studies were selected by searching PubMed from January 1996 to August 2005 using keywords "RNASEL gene AND prostate cancer." For each study, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated  to estimate the gene effect. Pooled estimates of the OR were computed using the random effects model. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall results suggested no major influence of these variants on prostate cancer risk. However,  analysis of the Asp541Glu polymorphism by ethnic populations showed that Asp/Glu  (familial cases versus control: OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.04-1.82; sporadic cases versus control: OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.48; prostate cancer versus control: OR,  1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.48) and Asp/Glu + Glu/Glu (familial cases versus control: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70; sporadic cases versus control: OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.44; prostate cancer versus control: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.44) increased prostate cancer risk in Caucasians, thus suggesting a dominant model for the Glu  variant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the genotype Asp/Asp, the Glu variant at the Asp541Glu polymorphism increases prostate cancer risk by <2-fold in Caucasians, regardless  of family history of the disease. This suggests that genuine genetic effects of this polymorphism may account for only a part of prostate cancer in the Caucasian population.

17001622|t|Characterization of the breast cancer associated ATM 7271T>G (V2424G) mutation by gene expression profiling.
17001622|a|Mutations in ATM are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia. Heterozygous mutations in ATM have been associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. We previously reported one breast cancer family in which ATM 7271T>G (V2424G) segregated with disease, and apparently acted in a  dominant negative manner. We now report the screening of 782 multiple-case breast cancer families that identified two additional index cases with ATM 7271T>G. Phylogenetic sequence analysis showed that V2424 is a highly conserved residue, and that the 2424G variant is likely to interfere with function. To elucidate the consequences of this mutation, we expression profiled wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from Scottish and Australian families using an oligonucleotide microarray. Cluster analysis revealed 77 genes  that were differentially expressed in homozygous and heterozygous V2424G cells (compared to wild-type) and 11 genes differentially expressed in the homozygous cells. We also evaluated the profiles of LCLs after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and identified 77 genes that were differentially expressed in wild-type cells, but not in homozygous or heterozygous V2424G cells. We validated the expression differences by RT-PCR in additional heterozygous V2424G LCLs from  another breast cancer family. We found no consistent cytotoxicity or abrogation of ATM kinase activity after IR in seven heterozygous V2424G LCLs, compared to wild-type LCLs, but did find an increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations. These data suggest that the V2424G missense mutation acts largely as a dominant negative in terms of the associated expression profiles.

16969499|t|Missense mutations of BRCA1 gene affect the binding with p53 both in vitro and in vivo.
16969499|a|Women with BRCA1 gene mutations have an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer (BOC). Classification of missense variants as neutral or disease causing is still a challenge and has major implications for genetic counseling. BRCA1 is  organized in an N-terminal ring-finger domain and two BRCT (breast cancer C-terminus) domains, involved in protein-protein interaction. The integrity of the C-terminal, BRCT repeat region is also critical for BRCA1 tumor suppressor function. Several molecular partners of BRCA1 have so far been identified; among  them, the tumor suppressor protein p53 seems to play a major role. This study was aimed at evaluating the impact of two missense mutations, namely the W1837R and the S1841N, previously identified in BOC patients and located in the BRCT domain  of the BRCA1 gene, on the binding capacity of this protein to p53. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of E. coli-expressed wild-type and mutated BRCTs challenged with a HeLa cell extract revealed, for the S1841N variant a significant reduction in the binding activity to p53, while the W1837R mutant showed an inverse effect. Furthermore, a clonogenic soft agar growth assay performed on HeLa cells stably transfected with either wild-type or mutant BRCA1  showed a marked decrease of the growth in wild-type BRCA1-overexpressing cells and in BRCA1S1841N-transfected cells, while no significant changes were detected  in the BRCA1W1837R-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that: i) distinct single nucleotide changes in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 affect binding of this protein to the tumor suppressor p53, and ii) the two missense mutations here described are likely to play a role in breast tumorigenesis. We suggest that in vitro/in vivo experiments testing the effects of unclassified BRCA1 gene variants should therefore be taken in to consideration and that increased surveillance should be adopted in individuals bearing these two BRCA1 missense alterations.

16963262|t|Identification of germline MLH1 alterations in familial prostate cancer.
16963262|a|Several linkage and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses suggest that the region 3p21-p26, which is a chromosomal location of MLH1, could harbour a susceptibility gene for prostate cancer (PRCA). Furthermore, in a recent candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis the I219V variation of the MLH1 gene was associated with PRCA. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and germ-line MLH1 mutations were originally demonstrated in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) but MSI and loss of MLH1 function have also been detected in PRCA. To assess the contribution of MLH1 germline mutations to the development of PRCA  in Finland different approaches were used. First, the samples from 11 PRCA-colon  cancer patients were screened for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC revealed one patient with a putative MLH1 aberration and sequencing of this sample revealed five sequence variants including two missense variants P434L and I219V. Second, the samples from Finnish hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families were used for the screening of MLH1 mutations which produced twelve MLH1 sequence variants including two missense mutations, I219V, as in the PRCA-colon cancer patient, and V647M. P434L and V647  were both novel, rare variants. Carrier frequencies of the I219V mutation were compared between hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) patients, unselected PRCA cases, patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and controls, but no differences between the sample groups were found. P434L was not present in this study population and V647M was a very rare variant found only in one HPC family. According to the present results, MLH1 does not have a major role in PRCA causation in Finland.

16941491|t|Unique substitution of CHEK2 and TP53 mutations implicated in primary prostate tumors and cancer cell lines.
16941491|a|Genetic defects in CHEK2 and TP53 have been implicated in prostate cancer development. However, the interaction of these two genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis has not been investigated. We previously described 11 CHEK2 mutations in a group of 84 primary prostate tumors. In this report, we screened the same group of tumors for TP53 mutations and revealed nine somatic and two germline mutations. One germline TP53 mutation (c.408A > T/p.Gln136His) and two somatic mutations (c.1022T > G/p.Phe341Cys and c.108-109ins22/p.His37fsX13) are novel to human cancer. More interestingly, CHEK2 and TP53 mutations were observed to be mutually substituted in these tumors. Analysis of five commonly used prostate cancer cell lines revealed that four cell lines harboring TP53 mutations carry no CHEK2 mutation while the only cell line (LNCaP) carrying wild-type TP53  harbors a CHEK2 mutation. The novel CHEK2 mutation (c.1160C>T/p.Thr387Asn) identified in LNCaP cells changes amino acid Thr387 to Asn which has been shown to impair CHEK2 autophosphorylation and activation. Our data suggest that the CHEK2 and TP53 mutations can substitute each other in at least 25% (21/84) of prostate cancers and that DNA damage-signaling pathway plays an important role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis.

16835864|t|Characterization of CHEK2 mutations in prostate cancer.
16835864|a|The checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2, also known as CHK2) is a tumor suppressor that participates in the DNA damage-signaling pathway. It is phosphorylated and activated following DNA damage, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Previously, we reported germline CHEK2 mutations in patients with prostate cancer. In this study, we have identified two novel somatic CHEK2 mutations, c.349A > G (p.R117G) and c.967A > C (p.E321K), in prostate tumor specimens and investigated the functions of these mutants in vivo. We have shown that most of the germline CHEK2 mutations and one somatic mutation (p.R117G) within FHA domain have modestly reduced CHEK2 kinase activity in comparison with wild-type CHEK2 while the other somatic mutation (p.E321K) within the kinase domain of CHEK2 totally abolished CHEK2 kinase activity. Given that several clinical CHEK2 mutations reside in the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, we further generated a  series of missense mutations within this domain and demonstrated the requirement  of an intact FHA domain for the full activation of CHEK2. Taken together, these results provide evidence that both germline and somatic CHEK2 mutations identified in prostate cancer may contribute to the development of prostate cancer through the reduction of CHEK2 activation in response to DNA damage and/or oncogenic stress.

16825437|t|Nordic collaborative study of the BARD1 Cys557Ser allele in 3956 patients with cancer: enrichment in familial BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer but not in other malignancies.
16825437|a|BACKGROUND: BARD1 was originally identified as a BRCA1-interacting protein but has also been described in tumour-suppressive functions independent of BRCA1. Several studies have indicated that the BARD1 gene is a potential target for germline changes predisposing to breast and ovarian cancer. The C-terminal Cys557Ser change has previously been uncovered to associate with an increased risk of breast cancer and was recently shown to result in defective apoptotic activities. AIM AND METHODS: Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis, minisequencing, TaqMan assays, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and DNA sequencing were used to investigate the prevalence of the Cys557Ser allele in a large Nordic case-control study cohort consisting of 2906 patients with breast or ovarian cancer, 734 with prostate cancer, 188 with colorectal cancer, 128 men with breast cancer, and 3591 controls from Finland, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden and  Norway. RESULTS: The frequency of the BARD1 Cys557Ser variant seemed to increase among patients from families with breast or ovarian cancer lacking BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations: a significant difference was obtained compared with controls (6.8% v 2.7%; p<0.001; odds ratio (OR) 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 4.0) and  with patients from BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-positive families (6.8% v 2.2%; p = 0.01; OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.2 to 8.3). In contrast, no major association with male breast, ovarian, colorectal or prostate cancer was observed. Additionally, a novel BARD1  allele resulting in Ser558Pro was identified in familial breast cancer cases. CONCLUSION: These results provide further evidence that BARD1 Cys557Ser confers a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in women.

16822847|t|FGFR4 Arg388 allele is associated with resistance to adjuvant therapy in primary  breast cancer.
16822847|a|PURPOSE: A recent study presented first evidence that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 388 of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) gene, causing a transmembrane domain missense mutation (Gly388Arg), is associated with disease outcome in node-positive breast cancer. This article addresses the clinical relevance of this SNP, FGFR4 genotype, phenotype, and HER2 regarding patient outcome and influence of adjuvant systemic therapy in a substantial primary breast cancer collective (n = 372; median follow-up, 94.5 months). METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of germ-line polymorphism was performed in uninvolved lymph nodes; FGFR4 and HER2 expression were assessed immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays. RESULTS: In 51% of patients, homo- or heterozygous Arg388 allele was present. No  correlation existed between FGFR4 genotype and expression or HER2 status. In node-negative patients, FGFR4 genotype was not correlated with disease outcome. In node-positive patients, however, FGFR4 Arg388 was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS; P = .02) and overall survival (OS; P = .04). Notably, this association seems to be attributable to relatively poor therapy response in Arg388 carriers, reflected in their significantly shorter DFS (P = .02) and OS (P = .045) among patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy. It is also seen as a significant interaction term in a multivariate proportional  hazards model with Arg388 carriers having only about half as much benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy as wild-type carriers. CONCLUSION: According to this study, FGFR4 Arg388 genotype is a marker for breast cancer progression in patients with adjuvant systemic therapy, particularly chemotherapy, and thus may indicate therapy resistance.

16760288|t|Y179C, F486L and N550H are BRCA1 variants that may be associated with breast cancer in a Sicilian family: results of a 5-year GOIM (Gruppo Oncologico dell'Italia Meridionale) prospective study.
16760288|a|BACKGROUND: Over 600 different pathogenic mutations have been identified in the BRCA1 gene. Nevertheless, numerous missense mutations of unknown biological function still exist. Understanding of biological significance of these mutations should help in genetic counselling to carriers and their families. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 104 patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer whose genetic counselling answered the criteria of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2003), were prospectively screened for mutations in all coding exons of the BRCA1 gene by automatic direct sequencing. RESULTS: During these mutational screening procedures one case presented three mutations classified in the Breast Cancer Information Core Database as unknown variants. These were 655A/G found in exon 8 of BRCA1, 1575T/C and 1767A/C found in exon 11 of the same gene. The identification of the three unknown variants in  the proband (16SIRIO) and in her mother and sister indicates that such alterations exist in cis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the charge and stechiometry variations determined by the changes in the amino acids Y179C, F486L and N550H might produce an effect on the conformation of the protein and, consequently, on its function.

16741917|t|The DU145 human prostate carcinoma cell line harbors a temperature-sensitive allele of p53.
16741917|a|BACKGROUND: Some nuances of mutant and wild-type p53 activity have been uncovered utilizing temperature sensitive (TS) alleles. However, few human tumor derived cell lines possess a TS p53 mutant. METHODS: The cell lines DU145 (heterozygous p53, P223L, and V274F) and PC3 (p53-null, where exogenous P223L and V274F were introduced individually or in combination) were examined for TS p53 activity as revealed by reporter construct  and target gene activation. RESULTS: TS p53 function was observed in DU145 and expression of the P223L allele in PC3 conferred a TS p53 profile. Activation of p21Waf1 demonstrated that P223L  TS activity may have been influenced by cellular context. CONCLUSIONS: The DU145 cell line harbors a TS mutant of p53 and, in addition to being a widely used model of human prostate carcinoma, may also reveal new insights into p53 function due to the unique transcriptional properties of its TS phenotype.

16652348|t|The ATM missense mutation p.Ser49Cys (c.146C>G) and the risk of breast cancer.
16652348|a|Homozygous mutation in the ATM gene causes ataxia telangiectasia and heterozygous mutation carriers may be at increased risk of breast cancer. We studied a total of 22 ATM variants; 18 variants were analyzed in one of two large population-based studies from the U.S. and Poland, and four variants were analyzed in all 2,856 breast cancer cases and 3,344 controls from the two studies. The missense mutation Ser49Cys (c.146C>G, p.S49C), carried by approximately 2% of subjects, was more common in cases than controls in both study populations, combined odds ratio (OR) 1.69 (95% CI, 1.19-2.40; P=0.004). Another missense mutation at approximately 2% frequency, Phe858Leu (c.2572T>C, p.F858L), was associated with a significant increased risk in the U.S. study but  not in Poland, and had a combined OR of 1.44 (95% CI, 0.98-2.11; P=0.06). These analyses provide the most convincing evidence thus far that missense mutations in ATM, particularly p.S49C, may be breast cancer susceptibility alleles. Because of their low frequency, even larger sample sizes are required to more firmly establish these associations.

16563154|t|Influence of the MDM2 single nucleotide polymorphism SNP309 on tumour development in BRCA1 mutation carriers.
16563154|a|BACKGROUND: The MDM2 gene encodes a negative regulator of the p53 tumour suppressor protein. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MDM2 promoter (a T to G exchange at nucleotide 309) has been reported to produce accelerated tumour formation in individuals with inherited p53 mutations. We have investigated the effect of the MDM2 SNP309 on clinical outcome in a cohort of patients with germline mutations of BRCA1. METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained for 102 healthy controls and 116 patients with  established pathogenic mutations of BRCA1 and Pyrosequencing technologytrade mark was used to determine the genotype at the MDM2 SNP309 locus. RESULTS: The polymorphism was present in 52.9% of the controls (G/T in 37.3% and  G/G in 15.6%) and 58.6% of the BRCA1 mutation carriers (47.4% G/T and 11.2% G/G). Incidence of malignancy in female BRCA1 carriers was not significantly higher in  SNP309 carriers than in wildtype (T/T) individuals (72.7% vs. 75.6%, p = 1.00). Mean age of diagnosis of first breast cancer was 41.2 years in the SNP309 G/G genotype carriers, 38.6 years in those with the SNP309 G/T genotype and 39.0 years in wildtype subjects (p = 0.80). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that the MDM2 SNP309 accelerates tumour development in carriers of known pathogenic germline mutations of BRCA1.

16503999|t|HFE H63D mutation frequency shows an increase in Turkish women with breast cancer.
16503999|a|BACKGROUND: The hereditary hemochromatosis gene HFE plays a pivotal role in iron  homeostasis. The association between cancer and HFE hetero- or homozygosity has previously been shown including hepatocellular and nonhepatocellular malignancies. This study was performed to compare frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D variants in Turkish women with breast cancer and healthy controls. METHODS: Archived DNA samples of Hacettepe University Oncology Institute were used in this study. The HFE gene was investigated by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: All subjects studied were free from C282Y mutation. Thirty-nine patients had H63D mutation and were all heterozygous. H63D allele frequency was 22.2% (39/176) in the breast cancer patients, and 14% (28/200) in the healthy volunteers. Statistical analysis of cases with HFE H63D phenotype showed significant difference between breast cancer and healthy volunteers (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HFE H63D mutation frequencies were increased in the breast cancer patients in comparison to those in the general population. Also, odds ratios (odds ratio = 2.05) computed in this study suggest that H63D has a positive association with breast cancer.

16434975|t|The R273H p53 mutation can facilitate the androgen-independent growth of LNCaP by a mechanism that involves H2 relaxin and its cognate receptor LGR7.
16434975|a|Mutations in p53 occur at a rate of approximately 70% in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (CaP), suggesting that p53 mutations facilitate the progression of CaP to androgen-independent (AI) growth. We have previously reported that transfection of p53 gain of function mutant alleles into LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive cell line, allows for AI growth of LNCaP in vitro. We herein confirm the in vivo relevance of those findings by demonstrating that the R273H p53 mutation (p53(R273H)) facilitates AI growth in castrated nude mice. In addition, we demonstrate that H2 relaxin is responsible for facilitating p53(R273H)-mediated AI CaP. H2 relaxin is overexpressed in the LNCaP-R273H subline. Downregulation of H2 relaxin expression results in significant inhibition of AI growth, whereas addition of recombinant human H2 relaxin to parental LNCaP promotes AI growth. Inhibition of AI growth was also achieved by blocking expression of LGR7, the cognate receptor of H2 relaxin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to demonstrate that p53(R273H) binds directly to the relaxin promoter, further confirming a role for H2 relaxin signaling in p53(R273H)-mediated AI CaP. Lastly, we used a reporter gene assay to demonstrate that H2 relaxin can induce the expression of prostate-specific antigen via an androgen receptor-mediated pathway.

16333312|t|BARD1 variants Cys557Ser and Val507Met in breast cancer predisposition.
16333312|a|BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING-domain 1) is a tumor suppressor whose protein product interacts with BRCA1, and in which rare somatic and germline mutations have been reported in breast, uterine, and endometrial cancers. We aimed to evaluate whether there are BARD1 genetic variants that contribute to breast cancer risk by screening the gene for germline alterations in 45 Finnish familial breast cancer patients and in seven patients with both breast and ovarian cancer. Two of the missense alterations identified (Cys557Ser and Val507Met) were recently suggested to associate with an increased breast cancer risk. We also analyzed these variants in large and independent series of familial and unselected breast cancer patients and healthy controls. No clearly deleterious mutations were detected in the initial mutation screening. No association of the  Cys557Ser and breast cancer risk was observed as the variant was found altogether in 1.4% (16/1181) of familial and 2.2% (34/1565) of unselected breast cancer patients, and in 2.5% (27/1083) of healthy controls. The frequency of the Val-allele of the Val507Met variant was modestly higher among breast cancer patients than among healthy controls, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. No statistically significant association of the Cys557Ser or Val507Met variants with any clinicopathologic parameters was observed. These results suggest that the contribution of the BARD1 germline variants to breast cancer predisposition is very limited, and that neither Cys557Ser nor Val507Met have an effect on familial breast cancer susceptibility.

16282370|t|Stress kinase signaling regulates androgen receptor phosphorylation, transcription, and localization.
16282370|a|Activation of signal transduction kinase cascades is known to alter androgen receptor (AR) activity, but the molecular mechanisms are still poorly defined. Here we show that stress kinase signaling regulates Ser 650 phosphorylation and AR nuclear export. In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, activation of either MAPK kinase (MKK) 4:c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or MKK6:p38 signaling pathways increased Ser 650 phosphorylation, whereas pharmacologic inhibition of JNK or p38 signaling led to a reduction of AR Ser 650 phosphorylation. Both p38alpha and JNK1 phosphorylated Ser 650 in vitro. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either MKK4 or MKK6 increased endogenous prostate-specific antigen (PSA) transcript levels, and this increase was blocked by either bicalutamide or AR small interfering RNA. Stress kinase inhibition of PSA transcription is, therefore, dependent on the AR. Similar experiments involving either activation or inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase:ERK signaling had little effect on Ser 650 phosphorylation or PSA mRNA levels. Ser 650 is proximal to the DNA binding domain that contains a nuclear export signal. Mutation of Ser 650 to alanine reduced nuclear export of the AR, whereas mutation of Ser 650 to the phosphomimetic amino acid aspartate restored AR nuclear export. Pharmacologic inhibition of stress kinase signaling reduced wild-type AR nuclear export equivalent to the S650A mutant without affecting nuclear export of the S650D mutant. Our data suggest that stress kinase signaling and nuclear export regulate AR transcriptional activity.

16280053|t|Mutation analysis of FANCD2, BRIP1/BACH1, LMO4 and SFN in familial breast cancer.
16280053|a|INTRODUCTION: Mutations in known predisposition genes account for only about a third of all multiple-case breast cancer families. We hypothesized that germline  mutations in FANCD2, BRIP1/BACH1, LMO4 and SFN may account for some of the unexplained multiple-case breast cancer families. METHODS: The families used in this study were ascertained through the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis of  the coding regions of these four genes was conducted in the youngest affected cases of 30 to 267 non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer families. In addition, a further 399 index cases were also screened for mutations in two functionally significant regions of the FANCD2 gene and 253 index cases were screened for two previously reported mutations in BACH1 (p. P47A and p. M299I). RESULTS: DHPLC analysis of FANCD2 identified six silent exonic variants, and a large number of intronic variants, which tagged two common haplotypes. One protein truncating variant was found in BRIP1/BACH1, as well as four missense variants, a silent change and a variant in the 3' untranslated region. No missense or splice site mutations were found in LMO4 or SFN. Analysis of the missense, silent and frameshift variants of FANCD2 and BACH1 in relatives of the  index cases, and in a panel of controls, found no evidence suggestive of pathogenicity. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that highly penetrant exonic or splice site mutations in FANCD2, BRIP1/BACH1, LMO4 or SFN contribute to familial breast cancer. Large scale association studies will be necessary to determine whether any of the polymorphisms or haplotypes identified in these genes contributes to breast cancer risk.

16172807|t|Nucleotide variations in genes encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 and serine proteinase inhibitor B10 associated with prostate cancer.
16172807|a|Genes encoding the serine proteinase inhibitor B family (SERPINBs) are mainly clustered on human chromosome 18 (18q21). Several serpins are known to affect malignant phenotypes of tumor cells, so aberrant genetic variants in this molecular family are candidates for conferring susceptibility for risk of cancer. We investigated whether eight selected non-synonymous variations within SERPINB loci at 18q21 might be associated with risk of prostate cancer in Japanese men. A case-control study involving 292 prostate-cancer patients and 384 controls revealed significant differences in regard to distribution of four missense variations in genes encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) and SERPINB10. The most significant association was detected for the N120D polymorphism in the PAI2 gene (P = 5.0 x 10(-5)); men carrying the 120-N allele (120-N/N and 120-N/D genotypes) carried a 2.4-fold increased risk of prostate cancer (95% confidence interval 1.45-4.07). Associations were also detected for three other missense polymorphisms in those two genes. Strong linkage disequilibrium in the region encompassing PAI2 and SERPINB10 extended to about 50 kbp. The results suggested that missense variations in one or both of these genes confer important risks for prostate cancer, and may be themselves tumorigenic. Although confirmative replication studies on larger cohorts are awaited, clinical examination of these variations may become useful for identifying individuals at  high risk for prostate cancer.

16168123|t|Strong evidence that the common variant S384F in BRCA2 has no pathogenic relevance in hereditary breast cancer.
16168123|a|INTRODUCTION: Unclassified variants (UVs) of unknown clinical significance are frequently detected in the BRCA2 gene. In this study, we have investigated the potential pathogenic relevance of the recurrent UV S384F (BRCA2, exon 10). METHODS: For co-segregation, four women from a large kindred (BN326) suffering from breast cancer were analysed. Moreover, paraffin-embedded tumours from two patients were analysed for loss of heterozygosity. Co-occurrence of the variant with a deleterious mutation was further determined in a large data set of 43,029  index cases. Nature and position of the UV and conservation among species were evaluated. RESULTS: We identified the unclassified variant S384F in three of the four breast cancer patients (the three were diagnosed at 41, 43 and 57 years of age). One woman with bilateral breast cancer (diagnosed at ages 32 and 50) did not carry the variant. Both tumours were heterozygous for the S384F variant, so loss of the wild-type allele could be excluded. Ser384 is not located in a region of functional importance and cross-species sequence comparison revealed incomplete conservation in the human, dog, rodent and chicken BRCA2 homologues. Overall, the variant was detected in 116 patients, five of which co-occurred with different deleterious mutations. The combined likelihood ratio of co-occurrence, co-segregation and loss of heterozygosity revealed a value of 1.4 x 10-8 in favour of neutrality of the variant. CONCLUSION: Our data provide conclusive evidence that the S384F variant is not a  disease causing mutation.

16123141|t|Molecular characterization of ring finger protein 11.
16123141|a|Ring finger proteins serve many vital functions within the cell. We have identified RNF11, a novel 154-amino acid ring finger-containing protein, which is elevated in breast cancer. Within its ring finger domain, RNF11 contains an AKT phosphorylation site (T135) that is situated within a 14-3-3 binding domain. In WM239 cells with constitutively active AKT, RNF11 exhibits seven distinct phosphopeptides as measured using two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. Upon inhibition of the AKT pathway or mutation of T135, the phosphorylation at one of  these sites is virtually eliminated, suggesting that AKT may phosphorylate RNF11  at T135. Moreover, RNF11 is phosphorylated by AKT in vitro and is recognized by phospho-AKT substrate antibodies. RNF11 shows enhanced binding to 14-3-3 in WM239 cells compared with that seen in the parental WM35 cells which have low AKT activity. Furthermore, treatment of WM239 cells with LY294002 reduces RNF11/14-3-3 interactions suggesting that RNF11/14-3-3 binding is regulated by AKT. In addition, RNF11/14-3-3 binding is enhanced by constitutively active AKT and is diminished by dominant-negative AKT. There is also reduced 14-3-3 binding  to T135E RNF11. RNF11 localization was altered from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  by activated AKT. Thus, phosphorylation of RNF11 by AKT either causes its nuclear localization or induces degradation of cytoplasmic RNF11. In addition, T135E RNF11, which does not bind 14-3-3 and is not phosphorylated by AKT, causes a greater enhancement of transforming growth factor-beta signaling than wild-type RNF11. It is clear that RNF11 function, localization, and potentially, degradation are regulated by AKT. Disregulation of proper RNF11 function by AKT may prove to be detrimental to patient outcomes, making RNF11 a potential target  for novel cancer therapeutics.

16061562|t|Identification and characterization of missense alterations in the BRCA1 associated RING domain (BARD1) gene in breast and ovarian cancer.
16061562|a|BACKGROUND: BRCA1 associated RING domain protein (BARD1) was originally identified due to its interaction with the RING domain of BRCA1. BARD1 is required for S phase progression, contact inhibition and normal nuclear division, as well as for BRCA1 independent, p53 dependent apoptosis. METHODS: To investigate whether alterations in BARD1 are involved in human breast and ovarian cancer, we used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and  sequencing on 35 breast tumours and cancer cell lines and on 21 ovarian tumours. RESULTS: Along with the G2355C (S761N) missense mutation previously identified in a uterine cancer, we found two other variants in breast cancers, T2006C (C645R) and A2286G (I738V). The T2006C (C645R) mutation was also found in one ovarian tumour. A variant of uncertain consequence, G1743C (C557S), was found to be homozygous or hemizygous in an ovarian tumour. Eleven variants of BARD1 were characterised with respect to known functions of BARD1. None of the variants appears to affect localisation or interaction with BRCA1; however, putative disease associated alleles appear to affect the stability of p53. These same mutations also appear to abrogate the growth suppressive and apoptotic activities of BARD1. CONCLUSIONS: These activities allowed us to identify one of the rare variants (A2286G; I738V) as a neutral polymorphism rather than a detrimental mutation, and suggested that G1743C (C557S) is not a polymorphism but may contribute to the cancer phenotype.

16039774|t|The 5alpha-reductase type II A49T and V89L high-activity allelic variants are more common in men with prostate cancer compared with the general population.
16039774|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare men with prostate disease with those from the general population regarding polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene and in the 5alpha-reductase II (SRD5A2) gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SRD5A2 polymorphisms A49T, V89L and R227Q, the androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeats and sex hormone status was investigated in  men with prostate cancer (CaP) (n=89), benign prostate hyperplasia (n=45) and healthy military conscripts (n=223). RESULTS: The SRD5A2 high-activity allele variants A49T AT and V89L LL were more frequent in CaP-patients compared to general population, p=0.026 and p=0.05, respectively. CaP progression was, however, independent of SRD5A2 variants. In contrary, men with GGN<23 had a higher risk of dying from the disease than their  counterparts with longer repeats. CONCLUSIONS: Men with CaP were more often genetically predisposed to a higher enzymatic activity in the turn over from T to DHT compared to the general population. In our population, androgen receptor genotype affected CaP outcome.

15870154|t|Cytochrome P-450 1A1 gene polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer: a HuGE review.
15870154|a|Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A1 plays a key role in phase I metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and in estrogen metabolism. It is expressed predominantly in extrahepatic tissues, including the breast. Four CYP1A1 gene polymorphisms (3801T --> C, Ile462Val, 3205T --> C, and Thr461Asp) have been studied in relation to breast cancer. The 3801C variant is more common than the Val variant. Both variants occur more frequently in Asians than in White populations. The 3205T --> C polymorphism has been observed in African Americans only. Little data are available on the geographic/ethnic distribution of the Thr461Asp polymorphism. The functional significance of the polymorphisms is unclear. In 17  studies, no consistent association between breast cancer and CYP1A1 genotype was  found. Meta-analysis found no significant risk for the genotypes 1) 3801C/C (relative risk (RR) = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 1.80) or 3801T/C  (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.19) versus 3801T/T, 2) Val/Val (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.74) or Ile/Val (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.76, 1.10) versus Ile/Ile, or 3) Asp/Asp (RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.20, 4.49) or Thr/Asp (RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.43) versus Thr/Thr. Future studies should explore possible interactions between CYP1A1 and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, markers of estrogen exposure, other lifestyle factors influencing hormonal levels, and other genes involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism or hormonal biosynthesis.

These enzymes were examined for the pre-tRNA cleavage and the RNase 65 activity. We did not observe any differences in enzymatic properties such as Km and k(cat) values between the wild-type tRNase ZL and its variants. We conclude that there is no causality between the enzymatic properties of tRNase ZL and the prostate cancer.

15714208|t|Mutation screening and association study of RNASEL as a prostate cancer susceptibility gene.
15714208|a|To date, germline mutations have been found in three candidate genes for hereditary prostate cancer: ELAC2 at 17p11, RNASEL at 1q25 and MSR1 at 8p22. RNASEL, encoding the 2',5'-oligoadenylate-dependant RNase L, seems to have rare mutations in different ethnicities, such as M1I in Afro-Americans, E265X in men of European descent and 471delAAAG in Ashkenazi Jews. In order to evaluate the relevance of RNASEL in the German population, we sequenced its open reading frame to determine the spectrum and frequency of germline mutations. The screen included 303 affected men from 136 Caucasian families, of which 45 met the criteria for hereditary prostate cancer. Variants were analysed using a family-based association test, and genotyped in an additional 227 sporadic prostate cancer patients and 207 controls. We identified only two sib pairs (1.4% of our families) cosegregating conspicuous RNASEL variants with prostate cancer:  the nonsense mutation E265X, and a new amino-acid substitution (R400P) of unknown functional relevance. Both alleles were also found at low frequencies (1.4 and 0.5%, respectively) in controls. No significant association of polymorphisms (I97L, R462Q and D541E) was observed, neither in case-control analyses nor by family-based association tests. In contrast to previous reports, our study does not suggest that common variants (i.e. R462Q) modify disease risk. Our results are not consistent with a high penetrance of deleterious RNASEL mutations. Due to the low frequency of germline mutations present in our sample, RNASEL does not have a significant impact on prostate cancer susceptibility in the German population.

15665273|t|Down-regulation of BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase by CDK2.
15665273|a|BRCA1, a breast and ovarian tumor suppressor, is a phosphoprotein whose cellular  expression level is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. BRCA1 interacts with BARD1 to generate significant ubiquitin ligase activity which catalyzes nontraditional Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, it is not clear how the activity is regulated and how this affects BRCA1's multiple cellular functions. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1 is down-regulated by CDK2. During the cell cycle, BARD1 expression can largely be categorized into three patterns: moderately expressed in a predominantly unphosphorylated form in early G(1) phase, expressed at low levels in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms during late G(1) and S phases, and highly expressed in its phosphorylated form during mitosis coinciding with BRCA1  expression. CDK2-cyclin A1/E1 and CDK1-cyclin B1 phosphorylate BARD1 on its NH(2) terminus in vivo and in vitro. Intriguingly, the BRCA1-BARD1-mediated in vivo ubiquitination of nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM) and autoubiquitination of BRCA1 are dramatically disrupted by coexpression of CDK2-cyclin A1/E1, but not by CDK1-cyclin B1. The inhibition of ubiquitin ligase activity is not due to the direct effect of the kinases on BARD1 because an unphosphorylatable mutant of BARD1, S148A/S251A/S288A/T299A, is still inhibited by CDK2-cyclin E1. Alternatively, BRCA1 and BARD1 are likely exported to the cytoplasm and their expressions are remarkably reduced by CDK2-cyclin E1 coexpression. Recognizing the importance of cyclin E1 overexpression in breast cancer development, these results suggest a CDK2-BRCA1-NPM pathway that coordinately functions in cell growth and tumor progression pathways.

15649950|t|Functional and genomic approaches reveal an ancient CHEK2 allele associated with  breast cancer in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
15649950|a|Functional and genomic approaches can be integrated to screen efficiently for pathogenic alleles in founder populations. We applied such approaches to analysis of the cancer-associated cell cycle regulator CHEK2 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We first identified two extended haplotypes at CHEK2 that co-segregated with breast cancer in high-risk families. We sequenced CHEK2 in a case representing each haplotype and discovered two novel amino acid substitutions, CHEK2.S428F in the kinase domain and CHEK2.P85L in the N-terminal  region. To assay these alleles for loss of CHEK2 function, we tested their capacity to complement Rad53 deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CHEK2.S428F failed to complement Rad53 and thus largely abrogates normal CHEK2 function, whereas CHEK2.P85L complemented Rad53 as well as did wild-type CHEK2. Epidemiologic analyses were concordant with the functional tests. Frequencies of  CHEK2.S428F heterozygotes were 2.88% (47/1632) among female breast cancer patients not selected for family history or age at diagnosis and 1.37% (23/1673)  among controls (OR=2.13, 95% CI [1.26, 3.69], P=0.004), whereas frequencies of CHEK2.P85L were 0.92% among cases and 0.83% among controls. On the basis of the experience of mothers, sisters and daughters of probands, breast cancer risk due  to CHEK2.S428F was estimated as 0.17 (+/-0.08) by age 60. We conclude that CHEK2.S428F increases breast cancer risk approximately 2-fold among Ashkenazi Jewish women, whereas CHEK2.P85L is a neutral allele. In general, these results suggest that selecting probands with extended haplotypes that co-segregate with disease can improve the efficiency of resequencing efforts and that quantitative  complementation tests in yeast can be used to evaluate variants in genes with highly conserved function.

15617028|t|Androgen receptor mutants detected in recurrent prostate cancer exhibit diverse functional characteristics.
15617028|a|BACKGROUND: Alterations in the function of androgen receptor (AR) and its signaling pathway may be responsible for the progression of prostate cancer. The  goal of the present study was to investigate the potential roles of AR structural and functional alterations in the progression of prostate cancer, and the relationship between the structure and function of the AR. METHODS: AR gene in 58 prostate cancer samples was examined for mutations using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Effects of mutations on the structure and function of AR were investigated by androgen-binding assays and transactivation assays, respectively. RESULTS: Four novel somatic mutations (G142V, D221H, E872Q, and M886I) were identified from recurrent prostate cancer samples. None of the AR mutants differed from wild-type AR (wtAR) in their abilities to bind the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone. However, these mutated AR exhibited diverse functional characteristics as compared with wtAR. G142V and D221H showed increased responses to DHT. E872Q could be abnormally activated by 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, and cyproterone acetate (CPA). Furthermore, E872Q and M886I presented increased responses to DHT in the presence of coactivators TIF-2 and CBP, but not p300. On  the other hand, although overexpression of corepressors N-CoR and SMRT could result in evident inhibition on DHT- or CPA-induced transactivity of wtAR and the AR mutants, N-CoR displayed stronger inhibitory effects on DHT-induced transactivity of the AR mutants (especially for E872Q and M886I) than that of wtAR. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of enhanced inhibitory effects of corepressors on the transactivity of the AR mutants found in prostate  cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here demonstrate that AR mutants found in prostate cancer had different functional alterations, which might play an important role in the progression of prostate cancer.

15342448|a|The glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes are involved in the metabolism of various carcinogens. Deletion polymorphisms in the genes GSTM1 and GSTT1 and a base transition polymorphism at codon 105 (Ile-->Val) in GSTP1 were investigated  in relation to breast cancer risk. Tobacco smoking and reproductive factors were  examined as potential effect modifiers. Individual data from seven case-control studies were pooled within the International Collaborative Study on Genetic Susceptibility to Environmental Carcinogens. To measure the effect of GSTs on breast cancer risk, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed adjusting for study center and age. The modifying effect was investigated by stratification on variables of smoking habits and reproductive history. A total of 2,048 cases with breast cancer and 1,969 controls were analyzed. The relative  odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of breast cancer was 0.98 (0.86-1.12) with the GSTM1 null, 1.11 (0.87-1.41) with the GSTT1 null, 1.01 (0.79-1.28) with GSTP1 heterozygous mutants, and 0.93 (0.62-1.38) with GSTP1 homozygous mutants. Stratification by smoking or reproductive factors did not reveal a modifying effect of these variables, nor was there any association between GSTM1 and age at diagnosis of breast cancer. This is the largest study investigating susceptibility to breast cancer due to polymorphisms in the GST genes. The results conclusively show that single gene GST polymorphisms do not confer a substantial risk of breast cancer to its carriers. Furthermore, GSTs did not interact with smoking or reproductive history to modify cancer risk.

15235021|t|Germline E-cadherin mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: assessment of 42 new families and review of genetic screening criteria.
15235021|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene are a well documented cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Development of evidence based guidelines for CDH1 screening for HDGC have been complicated by its rarity, variable penetrance, and lack of founder mutations. METHODS: Forty three new gastric cancer (GC) families were ascertained from multiple sources. In 42 of these families at least one gastric cancer was pathologically confirmed to be a diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); the other family had intestinal type gastric cancers. Screening of the entire coding region of the CDH1 gene and all intron/exon boundaries was performed by bi-directional sequencing. RESULTS: Novel mutations were found in 13 of the 42 DGC families (31% overall). Twelve of these mutations occur among the 25 families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and with pathologic confirmation of diffuse gastric cancer phenotype in at least one individual under the age of 50 years. The mutations found include small insertions and deletions, splice site mutations, and three non-conservative amino acid substitutions (A298T, W409R, and R732Q). All three missense mutations conferred loss of E-cadherin function in in vitro assays. Multiple cases of breast cancers including pathologically confirmed lobular breast cancers were observed both in mutation positive and negative families. CONCLUSION: Germline truncating CDH1 mutations are found in 48% of families with  multiple cases of gastric cancer and at least one documented case of DGC in an individual under 50 years of age. We recommend that these criteria be used for selecting families for CDH1 mutational analysis.

15217503|t|No germline mutations in the histone acetyltransferase gene EP300 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 negative families with breast cancer and gastric, pancreatic, or colorectal cancer.
15217503|a|INTRODUCTION: Mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, TP53, CHK2 and PTEN account for many, but not all, multiple-case breast and ovarian cancer families. The histone  acetyltransferase gene EP300 may function as a tumour suppressor gene because it  is sometimes somatically mutated in breast, colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers, and is located on a region of chromosome 22 that frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity in many cancer types. We hypothesized that germline mutations in EP300 may account for some breast cancer families that include cases of gastric, pancreatic and/or colorectal cancer. METHODS: We screened the entire coding region of EP300 for mutations in the youngest affected members of 23 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancer families with at least one confirmed case of gastric, pancreatic and/or colorectal cancer. These families were ascertained in Australia through the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation  Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer. RESULTS: Denaturing HPLC analysis identified a heterozygous alteration at codon 211, specifically a GGC to AGC (glycine to serine) alteration, in two individuals. This conservative amino acid change was not within any known functional domains of EP300. The frequency of the Ser211 variant did not differ significantly between a series of 352 breast cancer patients (4.0%) and 254 control individuals (2.8%; P = 0.5). CONCLUSION: The present study does not support a major role for EP300 mutations in breast and ovarian cancer families with a history of gastric, pancreatic and/or colorectal cancer.

The novel variant E233G in RAD51D is more highly represented in high-risk, site-specific, familial breast cancer cases that are not associated with the BRCA1/2 genes, with a frequency of 5.74% (n = 174) compared to a control population (n = 567) and another subset of breast cancer patients (n = 765) with a prevalence of around 2% only (comparison to controls, OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.12-6.03; p < 0.021). We found that the immunohistochemical profile detected in available tumors from these patients differs slightly from those described in non-BRCA1/2 tumors. Finally, the structural prediction of the  putative functional consequence of this change indicates that it can diminish protein stability and structure. This suggests a role for E233G as a low-penetrance susceptibility gene in the specific subgroup of high-risk familial breast cancer cases that are not related to BRCA1/2.

15146458|t|Identification of a functional mutation in pp32r1 (ANP32C).
15146458|a|No mutations or polymorphisms have previously been reported in pp32r1 (ANP32C; GenBank: AF008216.1). pp32r1 is part of the highly conserved ANP32 family, some of whose members are associated with control of histone acetylation, mRNA stability, and specialized forms of apoptosis. Although 87.6% identical at the protein level, pp32r1 is functionally distinct from pp32 (ANP32A) in its failure  to suppress oncogenesis in in vitro transformation systems and its tumorigenicity in in vivo assays. The present study found that pp32r1 expression levels vary among human tumor cell lines, with the highest levels found in prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. pp32r1 also appears to be polymorphic at nucleotide g.4520 and nucleotide g.4664 in human tobacco-associated oral mucosal lesions, human fibroblast cell lines, and several carcinoma cell lines. PC-3 human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells likewise appear to be polymorphic at these loci, but additionally contain a g.4870T>C transversion mutation. The mutation results  in a p.Tyr140His substitution, which lies in a functionally important region of the molecule. In the PC-3 prostate cancer line, the mutation is either homozygous, or hemizygous accompanied by loss of heterozygosity. ACHN cells stably transfected with pp32r1 containing this mutation showed a markedly increased rate of growth. The pp32r1 mutation could thus be causally associated with the neoplastic growth properties of PC-3, and be of potential clinical significance.

15101044|t|Functional consequences of ATM sequence variants for chromosomalradiosensitivity.
15101044|a| The ATM [for ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) mutated] protein plays a key role in the detection and cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in the ATM gene; however, their association with cancer risk or radiosensitivity remains to be fully established. In this study, the functional consequences of specific ATM SNPs on in vitro radiosensitivity, as assessed by micronuclei (MN) formation, were measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines established from 10 breast cancer (BC) patients carrying different ATM missense SNPs, six A-T patients, six A-T heterozygotes (A-T het), and six normal individuals. The BC, A-T het, and A-T cell line groups showed significantly higher mean levels of MN formation after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) than did the group containing normal cell lines, with similar levels in the BC and A-T het groups. Within the BC lines studied, the group composed of the six carrying the linked 2572T>C (858F>L) and 3161C>G (1054P>R) variants had a higher level of MN after IR exposure compared to that observed in the remaining four BC or in the normal cell lines. This increase was not related to the constitutive ATM mRNA level, which was similar in these BC and the normal cell lines. Our results indicate that alterations in the ATM gene, including the presence of heterozygous mutations and the 2572C and 3161G variant  alleles, are associated with increased in vitro chromosomal radiosensitivity, perhaps by interfering with ATM function in a dominant-negative manner.

15059511|t|[Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from breast cancer families in China Han people].
15059511|a|OBJECTIVE: To detect BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene germline mutation in the Chinese breast cancer families. METHODS: Samples of peripheral blood were collected to prepare genomic DNA by conventional techniques from 15 inherited breast cancer patients from 14 breast cancer families, 76 sporadic breast cancer patients, and 100 healthy controls based on informed consent. Exons 4, 8, 11 and 18 - 20 of BRCA1, and exons 1 - 14, 17 - 24 and 27 of BRCA2, were analyzed using DNA direct sequencing. RESULTS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found on the exon 11 of  BRCA1, 2 being silent changes without change of amino acid coding, and 4 with change of amino acid coding among which 2 were polymorphic amino acid alterations and 2 were pathogenic SNPs, i.e. mutational sites. One novel BRCA1 mutation, C1196T (Pro 359 Leu), was identified in a family breast cancer patients, who was  diagnosed at the age of 37. Another BRCA1 mutation, Trp 372 stop was found in a breast cancer patient who was diagnosed at the age 29. Eight SNPs were found on the exon3, 10 and 11 of BRCA2, among which 5 were silent changes and 3 were polymorphic amino acid alterations. A1093C (Asn289His) in exon 10 and A 3199G (Asn991Asp) in exon 11 being found simultaneously in the patients of 2 families but not appearing in pool DNA sample, and Asn 371 His appearing as A/C heterozygote in pool DNA sample. CONCLUSION: Two pathogenic SNPs have been found in BRCA1 and may be related to early-onset breast cancer. One of them may be a novel mutation characterized of familial breast cancer in China.

15042566|t|DNA adducts and p53 mutations in a patient with aristolochic acid-associated nephropathy.
15042566|a|BACKGROUND: Aristolochic acid-associated nephropathy (AAN) is a specific type of  renal disease that predisposes patients to a high risk of urothelial carcinoma. The authors have analyzed DNA from a patient who had urothelial malignancy 6 years after presenting with AAN and later had a breast carcinoma that metastasized to the liver. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was isolated from the primary breast tumor, the liver tumor, and the original urothelial malignancy and assayed for aristolochic acid (AA)-DNA adducts and mutations in the p53 gene. The adduct detected was the adenosine adduct of aristolochic acid I 7-(deoxyadenosin-N6-yl)aristolactam I (dA-AAI). In DNA from the breast and liver tumors the authors showed the same missense mutation in codon 245 (GGC-->GAC; Gly-->Asp) of exon 7 of p53. In contrast, DNA extracted from the urothelial tumor showed an AAG to TAG mutation in codon 139 (Lys-->Stop) of exon 5. CONCLUSION: A to T transversions, as observed here, are the typical mutations observed in the H-ras gene of tumors induced when rodents are treated with AA and correspond with DNA adduct formation at adenosine residues. These data indicate the probable molecular mechanism whereby AA causes urothelial malignancy.

14691288|t|Androgen receptor mutations in high-grade prostate cancer before hormonal therapy.
14691288|a|Androgen action is mediated through androgen receptor (AR), which appears to undergo structural and functional alterations during prostate cancer (CaP) progression. AR mutations have been infrequently reported in CaP before hormonal  therapy, but in untreated, advanced tumors AR mutations are suggested to be more  common. To investigate the frequency of AR mutations in aggressive CaP before hormonal therapy, we have analyzed AR coding region for aberrations in 21 paraffin-embedded prostate carcinoma samples (14 primary tumors, 7 metastases) of poor histologic differentiation. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism and  sequencing analyses revealed AR missense mutations in 29% (4/14) of the primary tumors and in one (14%) metastasis. Mutations resided in the transactivation domain and in the hinge region. One of the hinge region mutants, Ser646Phe, that  was identified in a patient with short endocrine therapy response, exhibited a markedly increased transcriptional activity on single androgen response element-containing promoters. In conclusion, AR mutations are frequent in high-grade CaP before initiation of hormonal therapy, and these mutations may play a role in poor therapy response and emergence of hormone-refractory CaP in some cases.

14683420|t|Applications of polymorphisms and pharmacogenomics in obstetrics and gynecology.
14683420|a|The number of reports investigating disease susceptibility based on the carriage  of low-penetrance, high-frequency polymorphisms has steadily increased over the last years. Evidence based on meta-analyses of individual case-control studies is accumulating, defining specific individual variations in disease susceptibility.  For example, genetic variations of the estradiol metabolism have been described as significant contributors to disease susceptibility with variations depending on ethnic background. In the field of obstetrics and gynecology, the genetic contribution of polymorphic markers to a series of disorders has been characterized. These disorders include recurrent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, breast cancer, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)-related complications such as thrombosis. Among other genetic markers, thrombophilic genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A polymorphisms, as well as genetic variants of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, for  example, CYP19 and CYP1B1, have been established as genetic risk markers and disease modifiers of recurrent and sporadic pregnancy loss and HRT-independent and -dependent breast cancer, respectively. In addition, meta-analyses of data in the literature established the TGFBR1*6A, GSTP I105V, and TP53 R72P polymorphisms, as well as the GSTM1 gene deletion as low-penetrance genetic risk  factors of sporadic breast cancer. With respect to genetic modulation of therapeutic effects, beneficial effects of estrogen replacement therapy and HRT are modulated by the carriage of single nucleotide polymorphisms, for example, osteoprotection and blood lipid changes by the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-a) PvuII polymorphism. Polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), ER-alpha, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and Factor V genes have been demonstrated to  modulate the timing of natural menopause. Lastly, a strong genetic contribution of polymorphisms to the development and the clinical course of endometriosis has  been established with data pointing to polymorphisms of the COMT, GST, NAT-2, and ER-alpha genes as susceptibility markers. In summary, the available evidence points to a number of polymorphisms of a wide variety of genes as strong hereditary determinants of the susceptibility to benign and malignant gynecologic and obstetric conditions.

14583476|t|Effects of RNase L mutations associated with prostate cancer on apoptosis induced by 2',5'-oligoadenylates.
14583476|a|The RNASEL gene, a strong candidate for the hereditary prostate cancer 1 allele (HPC1), encodes a single-stranded specific endoribonuclease involved in the antiviral actions of IFNs. RNase L is activated enzymatically after binding to unusual 5'-phosphorylated, 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A). Biostable phosphorothioate analogues of 2-5A were synthesized chemically and used to study  the effects of naturally occurring mutations and polymorphisms in RNASEL. The 2-5A analogues induced RNase L activity and caused apoptosis in cultures of late-stage, metastatic human prostate cancer cell lines DU145, PC3, and LNCaP. However, DU145 and PC3 cells were more sensitive to 2-5A than LNCaP cells, which  are heterozygous for an inactivating deletion mutation in RNase L. The RNase activities of missense variants of human RNase L were compared after expression in a mouse RNase L(-/-) cell line. Several variants (G59S, I97L, I220V, G296V, S322F, Y529C, and D541E) produced similar levels of RNase L activity as wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the R462Q variant, previously implicated in up to 13% of unselected prostate cancer cases, bound 2-5A at wild-type levels but had a 3-fold decrease in RNase activity. The deficiency in RNase L(R462Q) activity was correlated with a reduction in its ability to dimerize into a catalytically active form. Furthermore, RNase L(R462Q) was deficient in causing apoptosis in response to 2-5A consistent with its possible role in prostate cancer development. Our findings support the notion that RNASEL mutations and some variants allow tumor cells to escape a potent apoptotic pathway.

12949798|t|Ser217Leu polymorphism of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene associated with prostatic cancer risk in Japanese men.
12949798|a|The HPC2/ELAC2 gene may be associated with hereditary/familial prostate cancer (PCa). Two common missense variants (Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr) have been reported  in the gene. We performed mutational, allelotyping and expression analyses and a  molecular epidemiological study to clarify the relations between this gene and prostatic diseases, including PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in Japanese men. We screened for mutations in 109 patients with PCa including 11 patients from 1 hereditary and 9 familial PCa. Loss of heterozygosity and expression were analyzed. An epidemiological study was done in sporadic PCa (n=98) and BPH (n=143) using 1 novel (Ser627Leu) and 2 previously described polymorphisms of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene. Somatic or germline mutations were not confirmed in any cases of PCa. Loss of heterozygosity at 2 microsatellites, D17S1289 and D17S520, was detected in 1 of 38 and 1 of 35 cases, respectively. Expression analysis revealed decreased or absent mRNA expression in 6 of 38 tumors. Epidemiologic analysis showed that a Leu allele at codon 217 was significantly more frequent in patients with PCa than in controls (10.2% vs. 3.5%, odds ratio = 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-7.90). At codon 541, all patients with PCa or BPH and all control subjects had the Ala/Ala genotype. At codon 627, the incidence of the Leu variant was slightly, but not significantly,  higher in patients with BPH than in controls (7.0% vs. 2.8%, odds ratio = 2.59, 95% confidence interval, 0.94-7.13, not statistically significant). We concluded  that germline/somatic mutations of HPC2/ELAC2 are uncommon in PCa. Similarly, allelic imbalances at the gene locus and changes in expression are rare. Although no difference in allele frequency at Ser217Leu between patients with PCa and controls has been reported in a Western population, this polymorphism is a potential indicator of PCa risk in Japanese men and it should be examined in other ethnic groups.

12917204|t|The relationship between twenty missense ATM variants and breast cancer risk: the Multiethnic Cohort.
12917204|a|Deficiencies in tasks of detecting and repairing DNA damage lead to mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, a hallmark of cancer. The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), ATM, is a proximal component in performing such tasks. Studies of A-T families have suggested an increased risk of breast cancer  among obligate female heterozygous carriers of ATM mutations. Paradoxically, studies of sporadic and familial breast cancer have failed to demonstrate an elevated prevalence of mutations among breast cancer cases. We characterized the  prevalence and distribution of 20 ATM missense mutations/polymorphisms in a population-based case-control study of 854 African-American, Latina, Japanese, and Caucasian women aged >/==" BORDER="0">45 years participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. The study population included 428 incident breast cancer cases and 426 controls. The prevalence of variants ranged from 0% to 13.6% among controls and varied by ethnicity (0-32.5%). Overall, these data provide little support for an association of ATM missense mutations with breast cancer among older women. We observed only one sequence variation (L546V), common among  African-American women, to be overrepresented among all high-stage breast cancer  cases (odds ratio, 3.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-8.84). After correction for multiple comparisons, this observed risk modification did not attain statistical significance. The distribution of ATM missense mutations and polymorphisms varied widely across the four ethnic groups studied. Although a single missense variant (L546V) appeared to act as a modest predictor of risk, the remaining variants were no more common in breast cancer cases as compared with controls.

12872252|t|Mutational analysis of the BRCA1-interacting genes ZNF350/ZBRK1 and BRIP1/BACH1 among BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative probands from breast-ovarian cancer families and among early-onset breast cancer cases and reference individuals.
12872252|a|Two potential breast cancer susceptibility genes, encoding the BRCA1-interacting  proteins ZNF350 (or ZBRK1) and BRIP1 (or BACH1), have been identified in yeast two-hybrid screens. We sequenced these genes in probands from 21 families with potentially inherited breast/ovarian cancer, all of which were negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Families had at least one case of male breast cancer, two  cases of ovarian cancer, or three or more cases of breast and ovarian cancer. In  addition, 58 early-onset (before age 35) breast cancer cases and 30 reference individuals were analyzed. Of 17 variants detected in ZBRK1, a missense mutation  Val524Ile was identified in the proband of one high-risk family, but no other family members were available for testing. Of 25 variants identified in BRIP1, in addition to four common silent or missense mutations, we identified Gln540Leu, a  non-conservative amino acid change, in a single familial proband with inflammatory breast cancer, but this mutation was not present in her three relatives with breast cancer. Haplotype analysis suggests that all ZBRK1 SNPs fall within a single block with two SNPs capturing 92% of the haplotype diversity, while the BRIP1 SNPs fall in two blocks, with five SNPs capturing 89%  of the haplotype diversity. Based on sequencing of ZBRK1 and BRIP1 in 21 BRCA1/2-negative probands from inherited breast/ovarian cancer families, it appears unlikely that mutations in these genes account for a significant fraction of inherited breast cancer. Further analysis in unselected cases will be required to know whether the identified variants play a role in genetic predisposition to  breast cancer in the general population.

12856637|t|Elevated serum triiodothyronine (t3) in Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients carrying the I1307k allele of the APC (adenopolyposis coli) gene.
12856637|a|PURPOSE: The risk of developing any cancer in carriers of the I1307K mutation of  the adenopolyposis coli (APC) gene is significantly increased (odds ratio 1.5, P  = 0.01). One of the cancers associated with the I1307K mutation is prostate cancer (odds ratio 2.0, P = 0.14). Also, there is an association of APC mutations with thyroid cancer. In this study, we measured triiodothyronine (t3) levels in Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, with and without the I1307K mutation of the APC gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants in our study were found through urology and radiation oncology clinics in 1999 and 2000. All eligible patients were asked to  take part. All patients had been initially diagnosed on the basis of rising PSA or abnormal physical examination. Histological confirmation of diagnosis was obtained for all subjects. Ethnic background was confirmed for all subjects by self-report or interview. The I1307K allele of the APC gene was detected by amplification of DNA isolated from peripheral blood according to standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot blot procedures. Serum t3 level was determined by fluorescent immunoassay with a standard, commercially available instrument. RESULTS: We studied 77 patients. The youngest patient was 46, the oldest 88, average age 67 +/- 7.2 (mean +/- SD). Eleven males carrying the APCI 1307K allele had significantly higher serum t3 levels than 66 males carrying the wild type allele. There were no homozygotes for the I1307K allele. None of the males had a  t3 level that was above the normal range for our laboratory (137 ng/dl). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of increased serum t3 level with the APC I1307K allele  in prostate cancer patients is not surprising, given the mitogenic potential of t3. Further studies may clarify whether t3 elevation is the mechanism whereby APC gene mutations increase the risk of prostate cancer, or whether other pathophysiologic abnormalities are involved.

12810666|t|Contributions of ATM mutations to familial breast and ovarian cancer.
12810666|a|This study addresses the prevalence of ATM mutations and the association with breast cancer in Austrian families selected for a history of breast or ovarian cancer or both [hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC)]. In 270 HBOC families previously screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, 137 different sequence alterations of ATM were identified. Seven of these were mutations presumed to cause ataxia telangiectasia based on their effect on the ATM protein, including five that caused a protein truncation and two missense mutations in the catalytic kinase domain of the highly conserved COOH terminus of the protein. The seven mutations were found in 10 families (3.7%). In addition, one missense variant, L1420F, was observed in 13 HBOC families (4.8%) but was not observed in  any of the 122 healthy volunteers with no history of breast cancer. In addition,  the variant segregated with breast cancer in some of the families, suggesting that it may be pathogenic for breast cancer. Sixty-two additional variants of potential significance were observed in 65 HBOC families, but not in healthy controls. These variants included 24 sequence alterations with possible effects on splicing or protein-protein interactions. This study indicates that there is a significant prevalence of ATM mutations in breast and ovarian cancer families and adds to a growing body of evidence that ATM mutations confer increased susceptibility to breast cancer.

12786840|t|Cowden's disease: clinical and molecular genetic findings in a patient with a novel PTEN germline mutation.
12786840|a|We report a 54-year-old woman with Cowden's disease (CD) who was found to carry a novel germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The mutation (c.334C-->G) introduced a  splice donor site within exon 5 that caused the expression of an aberrant transcript lacking 159 nucleotides corresponding to codons 112-164. Clinically, the patient showed multiple benign hamartomatous lesions of the skin, papillomatosis of the lips and oral mucosa, polyposis coli and bilateral fibrocystic disease of the breast. In addition, she developed different types of  malignant neoplasms, including bilateral carcinomas of the breast and malignant melanomas of the skin. Molecular genetic analysis of a benign skin hamartoma and  an invasive ductal breast carcinoma revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at microsatellite markers on chromosome 10 in the carcinoma but not in the hamartoma. The breast carcinoma additionally carried a somatic TP53 point mutation (c.466C-->G; R156G) that was associated with LOH on 17p and nuclear p53  protein accumulation. Taken together, our findings indicate that benign hamartomas in CD may develop without loss of the second (wild-type) PTEN allele,  whereas the pathogenesis of malignant tumours, such as breast carcinomas, appears to require the complete inactivation of Pten as well as further alterations such  as the loss of p53-dependent growth control.

12783936|t|New paraoxonase 1 polymorphism I102V and the risk of prostate cancer in Finnish men.
12783936|a|BACKGROUND: Human serum paraoxonase eliminates carcinogenic lipid-soluble radicals. Because expression of the main human paraoxonase gene PON1 varies widely in humans, certain PON1 polymorphisms might be associated with increased risks of cancer. We sought new functional mutations in PON1 and determined whether known or new PON1 mutations were associated with the risk for prostate cancer in a prospective, random, population-based sample of Finnish men and in a  case-control study. METHODS: Serum paraoxonase activity was measured in 835 healthy men in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. PON1 mutations were identified by hierarchical phenotype-targeted sequencing in DNAs from the 100 men with the lowest paraoxonase activity in this cohort, and 1595 men in the cohort were genotyped for PON1 mutations by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Multivariable analysis was used to investigate the association of known and new PON1 mutations with incident prostate cancer in 1569 cancer-free men in the cohort followed for 9-14 years. In a case-control study of Finnish men, the association of prostate cancer with the PON1 mutation identified in the cohort study was investigated in 69 case patients with familial prostate cancer and 69 unmatched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: We identified a new single-nucleotide PON1 polymorphism associated with  decreased serum paraoxonase activity that caused an isoleucine-->valine change at codon 102 in exon 4 (I102V). Of the 1569 men cancer-free at baseline, 56 (3.6%) were carriers of the I102V mutation. After adjusting for age and cholesterol-lowering medications, the relative risk for developing prostate cancer during follow-up was 6.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1 to 19.2) among 102V allele carriers compared with noncarriers. Other PON1 alleles were not statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer. In the case-control  study, patients with familial prostate cancer were more likely to be carriers of  the PON1 I102V mutation than control subjects (odds ratio = 4.3, 95% CI = 0.9 to  21.5). CONCLUSION: The PON1 102V allele appears to be associated with an increased risk  for prostate cancer.

12702523|t|Prognostic value of p53 molecular status in high-risk primary breast cancer.
12702523|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the p53 gene are the most common genetic alterations in  human primary breast carcinoma and these mutations are often associated with worse prognosis and chemo/radioresistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis of the p53 gene was performed by fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis in 13 consecutive high-risk primary breast cancer (HR-BC) patients with 10 or more involved axillary nodes to evaluate its prognostic value. RESULTS: Three p53 mutations (23%) and four allelic variants were detected. After a median follow-up of 52 months the HR-BC disease-free survival (DFS) was 51% and overall survival 79%. All patients harboring a p53 mutation (p53(mut)) relapsed within 10 months of the median DFS while 67% of those showing a wild-type p53 status (p53(wt)) survive disease-free at a median follow-up of 43 months. One p53(mut) patient is still alive while all the p53(wt) patients survive at 56 months median follow-up. Two out of the four p53(wt) relapsing breast cancer patients showed the Arg72Pro allelic variant; one of these died at 75 months. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations may help identify a subset of very high risk breast cancer patients (vHR-BC) with worse prognosis.

12668615|t|A naturally occurring mutation in an ATP-binding domain of the recombination repair gene XRCC3 ablates its function without causing cancer susceptibility.
12668615|a|Inherited mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, whose protein products are necessary for the homology-directed DNA repair pathway, confer a dominant susceptibility to cancer. We have investigated whether mutations of genes encoding other components of the same DNA repair pathway can also affect cancer susceptibility. We have identified three novel non-synonymous substitutions in one such gene, encoding the RAD51-related protein XRCC3. One of these variants, D213N, occurs in a highly conserved ATP-binding domain and completely abrogates the ability of the transfected gene to correct the phenotype of XRCC3 deficient cells. The D213N variant was found in the heterozygous state in DNA from 3/1577 healthy individuals. However, we did not detect this variant at all amongst 187 breast cancer families and 1300 unrelated patients with common cancers. Thus we have no evidence that D213N increases the risk of cancer. We propose that not all components of the homologous recombination repair complex can act as cancer susceptibility genes.

12649339|t|Characterization of a novel breast carcinoma xenograft and cell line derived from a BRCA1 germ-line mutation carrier.
12649339|a|A human tumor xenograft (L56Br-X1) was established from a breast cancer axillary  lymph node metastasis of a 53-year-old woman with a BRCA1 germ-line nonsense mutation (1806C>T; Q563X), and a cell line (L56Br-C1) was subsequently derived from the xenograft. The xenograft carries only the mutant BRCA1 allele and expresses mutant BRCA1 mRNA but no BRCA1 protein as determined by immunoprecipitation or Western blotting. The primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, and xenograft were hypodiploid by DNA flow cytometry, whereas the cell line displayed an aneuploidy apparently developed via polyploidization. Cytogenetic analysis, spectral karyotyping, and comparative genomic hybridization of the cell line revealed a highly complex karyotype with numerous unbalanced translocations. The xenograft and cell line had retained a somatic TP53 missense  mutation (S215I) originating from the primary tumors, as well as a lack of immunohistochemically detectable expression of steroid hormone receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and keratin 8. Global gene expression analysis by cDNA microarrays supported a correlation between the expression profiles of the primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, xenograft, and cell line. We conclude that L56Br-X1 and L56Br-C1 are useful model systems for studies of the pathogenesis and new therapeutic modalities of BRCA1-induced human breast cancer.

12645254|t|[Studies of mutations in BRCA1 transactivation domain by visualization of chromatin structure].
12645254|a|Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1(BRCA1) account for approximately 40%-50% of familial breast cancer cases and for more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancer cases. Many cancer-predisposing mutations are located in the C-terminal region that functions as a transcriptional activation domain, but most of the mutations in the transactivation domain identified to date cannot be readily distinguished as either disease-associated mutations or benign polymorphisms. Because chromatin structure regulation is an early event in gene transcription control, the chromatin unfolding activities of different transactivation domain variants were compared with that of the wild-type transactivation domain by use of an approach that allows visualization of large-scale chromatin structure through lac repressor/lac operator recognition. To do this, different constructs of the transactivation domain were selected as follows: (a) the wild-type transactivation domain; (b) two polymorphisms (S1613G  and M1652I); and (c) four cancer-predisposing mutations (A1708E, M1775R, W1837R and Y1853 term). All of the constructs were made by fusing in frame with lac repressor. Western blot analysis indicated that all of the fusion proteins were expressed in A03 1 cells, in which multiple copies of the lac operator were integrated to produce a heterochromatic region of the genome. The chromatin unfolding assay showed that, like the wild-type transactivation domain, two variants that represent benign polymorphisms did not induce chromatin unfolding or only induced subtle change. Contrary to the behaviors of the wild type and two benign variants, four cancer-predisposing mutations in the transactivation domain superactivate the chromatin unfolding. The results suggest that the chromatin unfolding assay can aid in the characterization of deterious mutations in the C-terminal transactivation domain of BRCA1 and may provide more reliable presymptomatic risk assessment.

12628588|t|Detection of base sequence changes in the CEBPD gene in human breast cancer cell  lines and primary breast cancer isolates.
12628588|a|Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed on genomic  DNA from 97 human breast cancer samples and 10 breast cell lines to screen for mutations in the single exon C/EBPD gene. Three C --> T transitions resulting in  silent mutations were detected in three individual breast cancer samples. One breast cancer sample also contained a G --> T transversion (Q253H). The SUM-52PE  cell line contained an A --> T transversion (AAG --> TAG) resulting in a nonsense mutation (K180Stop). All mutations identified in genomic DNA isolates were in highly conserved regions of the C/EBPD gene. This study indicates that mutational alterations in the coding region of the C/EBPD gene are relatively uncommon in human breast cancer.

12602915|t|Androgen receptor gene alterations in Finnish male breast cancer.
12602915|a|Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene have been suggested to predispose to male breast cancer (MBC). Studies on MBC patients have not been based on the mutation screening of the entire coding region of the AR and the number of subjects has been small. Therefore, some AR gene alterations may have remained undetected. In the present study, we have comprehensively screened the entire coding region of the AR gene for mutations and also studied the role of AR CAG and GGC repeat lengths as risk factors for MBC in a cohort of 32 Finnish MBC patients. To estimate the possible involvement of the prostate cancer predisposing AR Arg726Leu germ-line mutation in MBC, this mutation was tested in  117 MBC patients. No germ-line mutations were found and the CAG and GGC repeat lengths were similar among MBC cases as among Scandinavian population. Our data indicate that the AR gene does not substantially contribute to MBC predisposition.

12516098|t|The patched polymorphism Pro1315Leu (C3944T) may modulate the association between use of oral contraceptives and breast cancer risk.
12516098|a|The gene coding for the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity gene patched (PTCH1) is mutated in several common human tumors. In mice, haplodeficiency at the Ptch1 locus results in severe histologic defects in mammary ductal structure. We found no mutations within the coding region of PTCH1 in 17 human primary breast carcinomas. However, the biallelic Pro1315Leu (C3944T) polymorphism of PTCH1 was significantly associated with breast cancer in 41 Bavarian patients compared to 85 healthy controls. We investigated whether this variant influences susceptibility for breast cancer in 611 breast cancer patients diagnosed by age 50 years and 1,057 controls matched by age and study region in Germany and in 1,093 breast cancer patients from the United Kingdom. Allele and genotype frequencies were not different between cases and controls. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an effect modification of oral contraceptive use (OC) on breast cancer risk by Leu-carrier status. Compared to women who have Pro/Pro and never used OC, Pro/Pro OC users had an increased odds  ratio for breast cancer of 1.7. The odds ratio was also 1.7 for Leu-carriers who  never used OC, but this was attenuated among Leu-carriers who ever used OC by 20%. The gene-environmental interaction was confirmed in case-only analysis of the German and British studies, yielding an interaction odds ratio of 0.7 for premenopausal women (p = 0.06). Longer duration of pill use was associated with a significantly greater risk reduction (p for trend = 0.015). Our novel observation of a differential effect of OC use on breast cancer risk by PTCH1 1315Leu-carrier status suggests the interesting possibility of the Sonic hedgehog/Patched (SHH/PTCH1) signaling pathway being involved in hormone-induced development of breast carcinoma.

12100746|t|A49T, V89L and TA repeat polymorphisms of steroid 5alpha-reductase type II and breast cancer risk in Japanese women.
12100746|a|BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is hormone related, as are cancers of the endometrium,  ovary, and prostate. Several studies have suggested that higher extracellular levels of androgens are associated with breast cancer risk, while biological evidence indicates that androgens are protective. The codon 49 alanine to threonine substitution (A49T), codon 89 valine to leucine substitution (V89L) and TA repeat polymorphisms of the steroid 5alpha-reductase type II (SRD5A2) gene are considered functional with respect to enzyme activity converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. To test the hypothesis that these three polymorphisms are associated with risk of breast cancer, a case-control study was conducted with patients of Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. METHODS: The cases were 237 patients histologically diagnosed with breast cancer, and the controls were 185 noncancer outpatients. DNA from peripheral blood was genotyped by PCR methods. RESULTS: The threonine allele of A49T was not found in our subjects. Compared with the V/V genotype of V89L, the L/L genotype was associated with a decreased risk (crude odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36-1.05). This was also the case for the TA(9/9) genotype, with an OR of 0.58 (95% CI = 0.13-2.63) relative to TA(0/0). Among women with the TA(0/0) genotype, however, the OR for the L/L genotype was 0.46 (95% CI = 0.24-0.88) compared with the V/V genotype, and those with the V/V and TA(0/0) genotypes had the highest risk. The  haplotype with the L and TA(9) repeat alleles was not found. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to our knowledge focusing on Japanese women,  suggesting that SRD5A2 polymorphisms might have an association with breast cancer risk. Further large-sample studies will be required to confirm the association and to assess any interactions with environmental factors.

12023985|t|A potential role for the XRCC2 R188H polymorphic site in DNA-damage repair and breast cancer.
12023985|a|An acquired genetic instability, resulting from the loss of some types of DNA repair, is an early event in the development of a subset of human cancers. The involvement of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of double-strand breaks in DNA implicates this pathway in the suppression of breast  cancer. A family of proteins related to human RAD51, including XRCC2, are essential components of this repair pathway. Using site-directed mutagenesis of XRCC2, we show that non-conservative substitution or deletion of amino acid 188 of XRCC2 can significantly affect cellular sensitivity to DNA damage, and that a  polymorphic variant at this site (R188H ), present on 6% of chromosomes in the population, has a weak effect on damage sensitivity. We tested the hypothesis that the R188H polymorphism could be a low-penetrance susceptibility factor for breast cancer, by genotyping 521 women with breast cancer and a total of 895 control women. Carriage of the rare allele of XRCC2 R188H was associated with breast cancer overall [odds ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=(1.0, 1.8)] and when younger-onset cases with a positive family history were compared with older controls with no family history [odds ratio 1.9; 95% CI=(1.0, 3.8)]. These  results support the hypothesis that subtle variation in DNA repair capacity may influence cancer susceptibility in the population.

11894125|t|Molecular cloning and expression of proto-oncogene FRAT1 in human cancer.
11894125|a|FRAT1 and FRAT2 genes, clustered in human chromosome 10q24, are human homologues  to mouse proto-oncogene Frat1, which promotes carcinogenesis through activation of the WNT - beta-catenin - TCF signaling pathway. FRAT1 and FRAT2 mRNAs are up-regulated together in a gastric cancer cell line TMK1, and also in 2 out of 10 cases of primary gastric cancer. Here, we isolated FRAT1 cDNA (AB074890), which showed two amino-acid substitutions (Gln57X and His58Asp) compared with human FRAT1 cDNA previously reported by another group (U58975). The Gln57-His58 FRAT1 allele isolated in this study was also identified in human genome draft sequences. FRAT1 mRNA was almost ubiquitously expressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Expression level of FRAT1 mRNA was relatively higher in esophageal cancer cell lines TE2, TE3, TE4, a cervical cancer cell line SKG-IIIa, and breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T-47D. Expression level of FRAT1 mRNA was  not significantly changed after all-trans retinoic-acid treatment in NT2 cells with the potential of neuronal differentiation. Expression of FRAT1 mRNA in MCF-7 cells derived from breast cancer was down-regulated by beta-estradiol. This is the first report on isolation of FRAT1 cDNA derived from the more common FRAT1 allele, and also on regulation of FRAT1 mRNA in human cancer cells.

11742035|a|Mechanisms of prostate cancer (CaP) recurrence during a combined androgen blockade (CAB) are poorly understood. Previously, the role of androgen receptor (AR) gene mutations underlying the CAB therapy relapse has been raised. To investigate the hypothesis that AR gene aberrations are involved in CAB relapse,  11 locally recurrent CaP samples from patients treated with orchiectomy and bicalutamide were analyzed for copy number changes and DNA sequence alterations of the AR gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization and single-strand conformation polymorphism, respectively. Altogether, base changes were detected in four tumors (36%). Three of them were missense mutations (G166S, W741C, M749I) and two were silent polymorphisms. Interestingly, none of the tumors had AR amplification. These data suggest that different AR variants are developed and selected for during various types of hormonal treatments, and also, that CAB achieved by orchiectomy and bicalutamide does not act as a selective force for AR amplification.

11705864|t|Association of E-cadherin germ-line alterations with prostate cancer.
11705864|a|In our recent cancer registry-based study, the incidence of gastric carcinoma was increased up to 5-fold in male relatives of early-onset prostate cancer (PCA) patients. This association may reflect the influence of genetic factors predisposing individuals to both tumor types. Germ-line mutations of the CDH1 gene at 16q have recently been associated with familial gastric cancer. Furthermore, two genome-wide linkage studies of PCA recently reported positivity  at 16q. We therefore identified families and individual patients with both gastric and PCA and investigated whether the CDH1 gene mutations were involved in cancer predisposition in these cases. Fifteen of the 180 Finnish hereditary PCA families (8.3%) had one or more gastric cancer cases. No truncating or splice site CDH1 mutations were identified by PCR single-strand conformational polymorphism in these families or in eight individual patients who had both prostate and gastric cancer. However, a novel S270A missense mutation in exon 6 of the CDH1 gene was seen in a single family with four prostate and two gastric cancers. A large-scale population-based survey indicated a higher prevalence of S270A among both familial PCA cases (3.3%; n = 120; P = 0.01) and unselected PCA  patients (1.5%; n = 472; P = 0.12) as compared with blood donors serving as population controls (0.5%; n = 923). We conclude that individual rare mutations and polymorphisms in the CDH1 gene, such as S270A, may contribute to the onset of PCA and warrant further investigations in other populations. However, the CDH1 gene does not appear to explain the link between prostate and gastric cancer.

11434510|t|Relationship between glutathione S-transferase M1, P1 and T1 polymorphisms and early onset prostate cancer.
11434510|a|There is evidence suggesting that polymorphic variations in the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are associated with cancer susceptibility. Inter-individual differences in cancer susceptibility may be mediated in part through polymorphic  variability in the bioactivation and detoxification of carcinogens. The GSTs have been consistently implicated as cancer susceptibility genes in this context. The  GST supergene family includes several loci with well characterized polymorphisms. Approximately 50% of the Caucasian population are homozygous for deletions in GSTM1 and approximately 20% are homozygous for deletions in GSTT1, resulting in conjugation deficiency of mutagenic electrophiles to glutathione. The GSTP1 gene  has a polymorphism at codon 105 resulting in an Ile to Val substitution which consequently alters the enzymatic activity of the protein and this has been suggested as a putative high-risk genotype in various cancers. We investigated the relationship between GST polymorphisms and young onset prostate cancer in a case-control study. GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genotypes were determined for 275 prostate cancer patients and for 280 geographically matched control subjects. We  found no significant difference in the frequency of GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotypes between cases and controls. GSTP1 genotype was, however, significantly associated with prostate cancer risk: the Ile/Ile homozygotes had the lowest risk and there  was a trend in increasing the risk with the number of 105 Val alleles: Ile/Val odds ratio (OR)= 1.30 (95% FCI 0.99-1.69), Val/Val OR = 1.80 (95% FCI 1.11-2.91); Ptrend = 0.026. These results suggest that the GSTP1 polymorphism may be a risk factor for developing young onset prostate cancer. We also found that carrying more than one putative high-risk allele in the carcinogen metabolizing GST family was associated with an elevated risk for early onset prostate cancer (OR 2.48, 95% FCI 1.22-5.04, Ptrend = 0.017).

11369138|t|Contribution of germline MLH1 and MSH2 mutations to lobular carcinoma in situ of  the breast.
11369138|a|Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an unusual histological pattern of non-invasive neoplastic disease of the breast occurring predominantly in women aged between 40 and 50 years. LCIS is frequently multicentric and bilateral suggesting a genetic basis to the disease. The high frequency of microsatellite instability in lobular breast cancers, coupled with increased risk of breast cancer associated with germline mismatch repair gene mutations raises the possibility that mutations MSH2 or MLH1 might confer susceptibility to LCIS. To explore this possibility we have examined a series of 71 LCIS patients for germline MSH2 and MLH1 mutations. No mutations were detected in MSH2. Two sequence variants were identified in MLH1. The first was a CTT-->CAT substitution, codon 607 (exon 16) changing leucine to histidine. The other mutation detected in MLH1 was a TAC-->TAA substitution codon 750 (exon 19) creating a stop codon, predicted to generate a truncated protein. These findings  suggest that mutations in MLH1 may underlie a subset of LCIS cases.

11212236|t|Inhibiting mutations in the transforming growth factor beta type 2 receptor in recurrent human breast cancer.
11212236|a|Members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family are potent inhibitors of the growth of many epithelial cell types. Transmembrane signaling by TGF-beta occurs via a complex of the serine/threonine kinases TGF-beta type 1  receptor and TGF-beta type 2 receptor (TGFBR2), and inactivating mutations in the latter have recently been detected in some primary tumors and in several types of tumor-derived cell lines. The most common mutations that have been identified in  TGFBR2 are frameshifts in a repetitive polyadenine region in replication error-positive colorectal carcinomas that result in a truncated protein and absence of receptor expression at the cell surface. A number of point mutations in the highly conserved serine/threonine kinase domain of TGFBR2 have also been reported, some of which have been correlated with either loss of trans-phosphorylation of TGF-beta type 1 receptor or constitutive activation of trans-phosphorylation. No TGFBR2 mutations have been reported in human breast tumors, but anomalous expression of TGF-beta in breast carcinomas suggests that TGF-beta signaling may be defective. We have therefore systematically examined unmatched sets of 17 primary and 17 recurrent breast tumor samples for mutations  in TGFBR2, restricted to those regions of the gene in which mutations have previously been reported. None of the previously reported mutations was detected, but four novel mutations (V387M, N435S, V447A, and L452M) were found in the kinase domain in recurrent tumors. No mutations were detected in primary tumors.  TGF-beta signaling was significantly inhibited by each of the N435S, V447A, and L452M mutations.

10901165|t|Identification of p53 gene mutations in breast cancers and their effects on transcriptional activation function.
10901165|a|Somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations found in human malignancies. In the present study, we studied 36 primary human breast carcinomas, using a polymerase chain reaction-single-strand  conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing analysis of exons 2 through 9 for the presence of p53 gene mutations. Six of 36 (17%) breast cancers contained  mutations within the core domain of the p53 protein responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding (codons 102-292); all 5 missense mutations clustered between codons 240 and 291 (codons 240, 243, 250, 285, and 291), whereas one nonsense mutation occurred at codon 199. By using recombinant PCR in  vitro mutagenesis, we introduced point mutations at codons 199 from Gly to stop (gly199stop), 240 from Ser to Ile (ser240Ile), 250 from Pro to Ala (pro250ala), 285 from Glu to Lys (glu285lys), and 291 from Lys to Asn (lys291asn), and all the p53 sequences were subcloned into the CMVneoBam vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. To test whether the mutants p53 were functionally wild-type (wt) or mutant, we transfected them to p53-null Saos-2 cells with a reporter plasmid containing a p53-responsive element, and performed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. Transient CAT assay for transcriptional activation revealed that one group, including gly199stop, ser240ile, glu285lys, and lys291asn, abolished the transcriptional activity, whereas the other group, including pro250ala, retained stronger transcriptional transactivation activity than that of wt p53.

10698474|t|Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450-1B1 and risk of breast cancer.
10698474|a|Cytochrome P450-1B1 (CYP1B1) is a major enzyme catalyzing the formation of genotoxic 4-hydroxyestradiol. This enzyme is also involved in the activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines, mammary carcinogens in experimental animals. CYP1B1 is genetically polymorphic, and the variations in the CYP1B1 gene may be related to the risk of breast cancer. We evaluated this hypothesis among 186 breast cancer cases and 200 age-matched controls as part of a large population-based case-control study conducted in urban Shanghai during 1996 to 1998. Genomic DNA from cases and controls was analyzed for genetic polymorphism in codon 432 (Val-->Leu) of the CYP1B1 gene using a PCR-RFLP-based assay. The frequency of the Leu allele was 53% in cases and 46% in controls (P = 0.06). Compared with those with the Val/Val genotype, women with the Leu/Leu genotype had a 2.3-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-4.5] elevated risk of breast cancer after adjusting for potential confounding variables. This positive association was more pronounced among postmenopausal women (Odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0-9.1) than premenopausal women (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.8-4.3). Elevated risks of breast cancer associated with homozygosity for the Leu allele were observed in virtually all subgroups of women defined by major risk factors for breast cancer. The results from this study were consistent with  recent findings from in vitro and animal experiments implicating a potentially important role of CYP1B1 in the etiology of human breast cancer.

10547570|t|Altered expression of p53 and its regulated proteins in phyllodes tumours of the  breast.
10547570|a|The histological characteristics of phyllodes tumours of the breast are often not related to their clinical outcome. Additional studies must therefore be performed to investigate the possible relationship of cell biological parameters to the biological behaviour of these tumours. The expression of Ki-67, p53, and its regulated proteins has been studied in 19 primary phyllodes tumours, from patients with known follow-up, using immunohistochemical and molecular biological techniques. Overexpression of the p53 protein was observed in four cases and mutation in two cases. In only one case, the sequence alteration, at codon 273, was associated with overexpression of p53 protein and with strong expression of Ki-67 (30 per cent). This alteration was found in the primary, the recurrent, and the metastatic tumour samples. Moreover, the same p53 gene mutation, Arg273Cys, was detected in all tumour samples. No mutation was found in adjacent normal breast tissue, indicating that this was an acquired mutation. Unexpectedly, strong BAX expression was observed in the primary tumour. The patient died during the follow-up period. It is concluded that p53 gene status and an accumulation of BAX, both involved in the same apoptosis-controlling pathway, may be of prognostic relevance in phyllodes tumours.

10534763|t|Identification of germline missense mutations and rare allelic variants in the ATM gene in early-onset breast cancer.
10534763|a|Epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of breast cancer in obligate ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes. We analyzed 100 samples from young breast cancer patients for mutations in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the  gene responsible for the autosomal recessive condition, A-T, to determine whether A-T heterozygosity predisposes such individuals to develop breast cancer. These patients were selected from families with a moderate or absent family history of  breast cancer and included a subset of 16 radiosensitive patients. Forty-four germline sequence variants were detected by fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatch of RT-PCR products. These included seven rare variants found in nine patients (three described for the first time), but no truncating mutations. Although three variants were detected in the radiosensitive subset, this was not  statistically significant compared to the nonradiosensitive group. One variant, G2765S, is likely to be a missense mutation, but the other six variants probably  represent rare polymorphisms. However, five of the seven rare germline variants detected showed loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type ATM allele for one or more markers close to the ATM locus in matched tumor DNA. This high rate of somatic inactivation of ATM may indicate either that these rare variants play a role in breast cancer development or alternatively that a neighboring tumor suppressor gene is important for tumorigenesis. We found germline truncating ATM  mutations to be rare in these young breast cancer patients and therefore they are unlikely to play a role in the etiology of their disease.

10485478|t|Altered ligand binding by insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptors bearing missense mutations in human cancers.
10485478|a|The M6P/IGF2R gene, encoding the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF2R), is frequently inactivated during carcinogenesis. M6P/IGF2R is postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene due to its ability to bind  and degrade the mitogen IGF-II, promote activation of the growth inhibitor transforming growth factor beta, and regulate the targeting of lysosomal enzymes. In this study, we determined the effects of four M6P/IGF2R missense mutations associated with loss of heterozygosity in hepatocellular and breast cancers on the ligand binding properties of full-length membrane-bound receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare COOH-terminal, c-myc epitope-tagged human IGF2R cDNA expression constructs bearing point mutations that lead to the substitutions I1572T, G1464E, G1449V, and Q1445H, all of which are located in the receptor's extracytoplasmic domain. Ligand binding was measured in plasma membranes from 293T cells expressing full-length receptors. No binding of 125I-IGF-II to I1572T mutant receptors was observed. Binding to G1449V mutant receptors was decreased by 50% relative to wild-type (WT). However, IGF-II binding to the G1464E and Q1445H mutant receptors was equivalent to WT when plasma membranes were assayed immediately after preparation. The phosphomannosylated pseudoglycoprotein pentamannose 6-phosphate-BSA (PMP-BSA) was synthesized as a ligand for the M6P binding site. Binding of 125I-PMP-BSA was equivalent to WT for the I1572T, G1464E, and Q1445H mutations, but there was a 60% reduction in PMP-BSA binding to the G1449V mutant receptor. Thus, several missense mutations in M6P/IGF2R disrupt the ligand binding functions of the intact IGF2R, lending further support to the hypothesis that the M6P/IGF2R is a tumor suppressor gene.

10477429|t|TP53 mutation and haplotype analysis of two large African American families.
10477429|a|Two large apparently unrelated African American families with a high incidence of breast cancer and other tumors characteristic of Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome were studied. Mutation screening revealed that in both families the affected members carried a germline mutation of the TP53 gene at codon 133 (ATG--> ACG, M133T). In order to determine whether an ancestral haplotype was shared by these two families, polymorphic markers within and flanking the TP53 gene were studied. Haplotype analysis using five markers revealed an identical haplotype shared by the two families. Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus in the probands' tumor tissues from each family  was observed; in each case, the retained allele carried the common haplotype. The frequency of this haplotype in the general African American population is <0.003. This unique haplotype, combined with the rare TP53 mutation, suggests that these  African American families share a common ancestry. This finding suggests that other African Americans may be carriers of this mutation and thus may be at risk  of early-onset breast cancer or other cancers characteristic of the Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome. The finding of recurring mutations in African Americans may facilitate carrier screening and identification in this population.

9874460|t|Very frequent p53 mutations in metastatic prostate carcinoma and in matched primary tumors.
9874460|a|BACKGROUND: The frequency of mutant p53 in bone marrow metastases of patients with carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) and in matched sets of metastatic and primary lesions from the same patients was investigated. The data were examined in relation to prior treatment with androgen ablation (AA) therapy and were compared with the frequency of mutant p53 reported for primary CaP. METHODS: Seventeen patients with M1b (bone metastasis: TNM Stage IV) CaP had either unilateral or bilateral bone marrow biopsies taken for these studies. Specimens were divided and the outer one-third examined histologically to confirm the presence of CaP cells. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for accumulated p53 protein was performed by an antibody cocktail technique. RNA was extracted from the remaining portion of the biopsy, and p53 transcripts were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and screened for base sequence changes in the exon 4-11 region using nonisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Ten of 17 metastases (59%) demonstrated accumulation of p53. Six of 7 (86%) of the p53 IHC positive bone marrow samples contained RT-PCR-SSCP abnormalities, as did 2 of 3 IHC negative samples. Overall, 12 of 17 metastases (71%) contained mutant p53. Four of 7 biopsies (57%) retrieved prior to AA contained mutant p53, whereas 8 of 10 post-AA biopsies (80%) contained mutant p53. One patient showed identical SSCP abnormalities in right and left iliac crest metastases after therapy, and in this patient DNA sequencing demonstrated a missense mutation at codon 126 (TAC --> GGC, Tyr --> Gly). Archival primary cancers from seven patients were retrieved. All seven were IHC positive for p53 accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are associated with increased metastatic potential of  CaP. Abnormalities are found at approximately twice the frequency in metastases than in unselected samples of primary CaP, whereas in matched specimens there is  a high rate of consonance. Mutant p53 may contribute to systemic therapy resistance, due to increased association with post-AA CaP specimens.

9825943|t|Astrocytomas and choroid plexus tumors in two families with identical p53 germline mutations.
9825943|a|Germline p53 mutations carry an increased risk of development of breast cancer, soft tissue and osteosarcomas, brain tumors, leukemia and adrenocortical carcinomas. Cerebral neoplasms are usually of astrocytic lineage and occur in 40% of affected families. This report presents clinical, neuropathological and molecular genetic data from 2 families in France with an identical p53 germline mutation in codon 248 (CGG->TGG; Arg->Trp) and a clustering of CNS tumors. The youngest patient in each family developed a malignant choroid plexus tumor while  several young adults of both kindred succumbed to low-grade astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. The only non-neural neoplasm was an adrenocortical carcinoma in a boy aged 4 years who developed an anaplastic choroid plexus papilloma 2 years later. Of 2 previously reported inherited choroid plexus tumors, 1 occurred in a family which also carried a germline mutation in codon 248. It remains to be shown whether this unusual pattern of CNS tumors is due to an organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or whether it reflects the genetic background of the affected families.

9806478|t|Screening for tumour suppressor p16(CDKN2A) germline mutations in Israeli melanoma families.
9806478|a|Approximately ten percent of patients with malignant melanoma have family histories of the disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Germline mutations in tumour suppressor p16 gene have been implicated as disease causing mutations in some of the melanoma families. The frequency of families with p16 germline mutations among melanoma prone families varies from eight to fifty percent. The range of the variability is influenced apparently by the number of melanoma affected individuals within the family, as well as by other, yet unidentified factors. Ethnic background is known to determine both the frequency and the nature of germline alterations. Recently, specific mutations in tumour suppressor genes involved in breast cancer and in colon cancer were found at elevated frequency among Ashkenazi Jews. This report describes results of a screening for  p16 germline alterations in a collection of Israeli melanoma families. We have analyzed genomic DNA from thirty one Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jewish melanoma  families, as well as from thirty melanoma patients without an apparent family history of the disease. The entire coding region of the p16 gene was screened by  single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. We have detected a number of carriers with the Ala148 Thr polymorphism at the end of the second exon and several instances of 500(G=>C) substitution at the 3' untranslated portion of the gene.

9635571|t|Beta-catenin mutations in human prostate cancer.
9635571|a|Beta-catenin plays essential roles in both intercellular adhesion and signal transduction. As a signaling molecule, beta-catenin supplies an activating domain to the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor family of DNA-binding proteins and activates gene transcription. Posttranslational stabilization of beta-catenin, leading to elevated protein levels and constitutive gene activation, has been proposed as an important step in oncogenesis. Stabilization  of beta-catenin can occur through mutation to highly conserved amino acids encoded in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1). To determine whether this pathway of malignant transformation is important in prostate cancer, we analyzed  104 prostate cancer tissue specimens, 4 prostate cancer cell lines, and 3 prostate tumor xenografts for activating mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1. Mutations were detected in 5 of the 104 prostate cancer tissue samples. Four of the five mutations involved serine or threonine residues implicated in the degradation of  beta-catenin. A fifth tumor had a mutation at codon 32, changing a highly conserved aspartic acid to a tyrosine. Mutational analysis of multiple regions from several tumor samples showed that the beta-catenin mutations were present focally and therefore may occur during tumor progression.

9585599|t|Missense mutations in disease genes: a Bayesian approach to evaluate causality.
9585599|a|The problem of interpreting missense mutations of disease-causing genes is an increasingly important one. Because these point mutations result in alteration of only a single amino acid of the protein product, it is often unclear whether this change alone is sufficient to cause disease. We propose a Bayesian approach that  utilizes genetic information on affected relatives in families ascertained through known missense-mutation carriers. This method is useful in evaluating known disease genes for common disease phenotypes, such as breast cancer or colorectal cancer. The posterior probability that a missense mutation is disease  causing is conditioned on the relationship of the relatives to the proband, the population frequency of the mutation, and the phenocopy rate of the disease. The  approach is demonstrated in two cancer data sets: BRCA1 R841W and APC I1307K. In  both examples, this method helps establish that these mutations are likely to be  disease causing, with Bayes factors in favor of causality of 5.09 and 66.97, respectively, and posterior probabilities of .836 and .985. We also develop a simple approximation for rare alleles and consider the case of unknown penetrance and allele frequency.

9419972|t|Resistance of MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells to TNF-induced cell death is associated with loss of p53 function.
9419972|a|We have investigated the relationship between the development of tumor resistance towards the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and p53 function, using the TNF-sensitive MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and  two TNF-resistant sublines, MCF7/R-A1 and MCF7/Adr. Use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing shows that MCF7 has  a wild-type p53 gene, whereas both TNF-resistant sublines exhibit mutant p53. This includes a point mutation R280K in MCF7/R-A1 cells, and a point mutation at  the splicing acceptor site on the upstream border of exon 5 resulting in a 21 pb  deletion in MCF7/Adr cells. These mutations result in loss of p53 capacity to transactivate FASAY (functional assay in yeast). In contrast to what is observed  for parental MCF7 cells, treatment of resistant sublines with TNF or gamma-irradiation fails neither to induce the expression of the p53-regulated gene products p21waf1/CIP1 and MDM2, nor to arrest the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Disruption of p53 wild-type function in MCF7 cells by transfection with human papillomavirus type-16 E6 gene, leads to abrogation of the cytotoxic, but not the cytostatic activity of TNF. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that wild-type p53 is involved in cytotoxic action of TNF, and point out that loss of p53 function contributes to resistance of tumor cell to TNF-induced killing.

9407971|t|Abrogation of wild-type p53-mediated transactivation is insufficient for mutant p53-induced immortalization of normal human mammary epithelial cells.
9407971|a|The p53 protein has become a subject of intense interest since the discovery that about 50% of human cancers carry p53 mutations. Mutations in the p53 gene are the most frequent genetic lesions in breast cancer, suggesting a critical role for p53 protein in normal mammary epithelial cell (MEC) growth control. We previously demonstrated that abrogation of the p53 function by a cancer-derived p53 mutant,  del239, was sufficient to induce immortalization of normal MECs. To further extend these findings and to examine the mechanism of mutant p53-induced immortalization of MECs, we tested the immortalizing ability of four selected p53 mutants (R175H, R248W, R249S, and R273H), which involve residues that cluster close to N239 in the three-dimensional structure and which are critical for the DNA-binding function of p53. Interestingly, two of these mutants (R175H and R249S) reproducibly immortalized 76N normal MECs, whereas the other two mutants (R248W and R273H) induced an extension of life span but not immortalization. These results further substantiate that selective ablation of p53 function with dominant-negative mutants is sufficient for immortalization of MECs. To determine whether abrogation of the transactivation function of endogenous p53 was important for the differential immortalizing ability of p53 mutants, we measured  the effects of mutant p53 on the endogenous wild-type p53-mediated transactivation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter linked to a consensus p53 binding DNA sequence in transiently transfected 76N MECs. All of the mutants, regardless of their immortalizing phenotype, abrogated the endogenous wild-type p53-mediated transactivation to a similar extent. Thus, abrogation of transactivation function is not sufficient for mutant p53-induced immortalization of normal MECs. The p53-immortalized MECs showed substantial telomerase activity; however, induction of telomerase activity occurred at late passages and was undetectable in mutant p53-expressing cells prior to immortalization. We suggest that mechanisms other than abrogation of transactivation and induction of telomerase activity determine the differential MEC-immortalizing behavior of various p53 mutants.

9302181|t|Identification of two germline point mutations in the 5'UTR of the androgen receptor gene in men with prostate cancer.
9302181|a|PURPOSE: As part of an ongoing study to identify germline mutations and/or polymorphisms in the androgen receptor (AR) gene which might be associated with prostate cancer, the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of the AR gene was screened in genomic DNA of prostate cancer cases. This region, which is > 1 kb in length,  might modulate AR expression by affecting transcription and/or translation rates. A life-time exposure to enhanced AR expression, in turn, could potentially predispose to prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA samples from 38 prostate cancer cases were analyzed for mutations in the 5'UTR of the AR gene. RESULTS: Two mutations were identified. One mutation, G2T, is located within the  AR transcription initiation site 1 (AR-TIS I), and the second, C214A, within a GC rich region of the 5'UTR. CONCLUSIONS: Although 5'UTR mutations in the AR gene might only rarely occur in men with prostate cancer, the occasional mutation in this area may contribute to  the disease by altering rates of transcription and/or translation of this gene.

8710380|t|A novel p53 germline alteration identified in a late onset breast cancer kindred.
8710380|a|Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by childhood sarcoma, leukemia and early onset breast cancer and has occasionally been found also in familial breast-ovarian cancer. Most mutations found are of missense type and located in the central region of the gene (exons 5 to 8). In the present study, a germline p53 alteration was identified in a late onset breast cancer family (kindred Lund  5; mean age 58 years) using single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. The mutation (a CCG to CTG transition) at codon 82 in exon 4,  resulting in a proline to leucine substitution, has not previously been reported  and was not present in a control set of 60 healthy individuals. Three of five woman with breast cancer (45, 57 and 65 years) were carriers of the alteration. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was not seen in the primary tumors of these women, but appeared as a partial loss of the wildtype allele in subsequent  recurrent lesions of two gene carriers. The family manifested no linkage to the p53 gene (a two-point LOD-score of -0.41), and has previously also been excluded  for linkage to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci, as well as being carrier of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Although it seems unlikely that the p53 germline mutation is the major cause of disease predisposition in Lund 5, the data suggest that some p53 alteration may confer a subtle influence on breast cancer development and progression.

9815913|t|p53 mutation and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.
9815913|a|A substantial portion of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer fail to respond to estrogen depletion or to the antiestrogen tamoxifen. The molecular changes that lead to tamoxifen resistance and estrogen-independent growth are unknown. To test the hypothesis that a p53 mutation could result in tamoxifen resistance and estrogen-independent growth, the MCF-7 cell line was transfected with p53 cDNA which was mutated at codon 179 (histidine to glutamine). MCF-7 is an estrogen receptor-positive, estrogen-dependent, tamoxifen-sensitive cell line with only wild-type p53. The presence of transfected mutant p53 cDNA was verified by the PCR, and overexpression of p53 protein was assessed by Western blotting. Five separate mutant-transfected clones were selected and tested in subsequent growth experiments. In monolayer culture,  there was no consistent evidence of estrogen-independent growth or tamoxifen resistance in the mutant transfectants compared with vector-only controls or the  parental cell line. In soft agar growth experiments, four of five mutant transfectants remained sensitive to tamoxifen in a dose-dependent manner. In the  presence of wild-type p53, mutant 179 p53 protein does not result in estrogen-independent growth or tamoxifen resistance. These results do not exclude the possibility that other p53 mutational types could result in tamoxifen resistance, or that loss of the remaining wild-type allele may be necessary to result in this phenotype.

7798298|t|Aberrations of the APC gene in primary breast carcinoma.
7798298|a|Aberrations of the APC gene, which plays an important role in the genesis of familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal carcinoma, were investigated in 31  surgical specimens of primary breast carcinoma. These studies utilized the polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction-fragment-length polymorphism and single-strand-conformation polymorphism analyses combined with tumor cell enrichment by cell sorting. Loss of heterozygosity at the APC locus was detected  in 8 (38%) of 21 informative cases, but only 2 (6%) of 31 tumors carried a mutated APC gene. Direct DNA sequencing analysis confirmed mutations at codon 1081 (AGC to ATC) resulting in an amino acid substitution of serine for isoleucine, and at codon 1096 (CAG to CAT) resulting in a substitution of glutamine for histidine. There were no significant correlations between the loss  of heterozygosity or mutation at the APC locus and any clinicopathological characteristics. Our present observations suggest that the mutations of the APC gene may play an important role in the genesis of certain breast carcinomas, and  that another tumor-suppressor gene, which is the true target of frequent loss of  heterozygosity, may exist near the APC gene.

22016685|t|A novel missense mutation Asp506Gly in Exon 13 of the F11 gene in an asymptomatic Korean woman with mild factor XI deficiency.
22016685|a|Factor XI (FXI) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive coagulation disorder most commonly found in Ashkenazi and Iraqi Jews, but it is also found in other ethnic groups. It is a trauma or surgery-related bleeding disorder, but spontaneous bleeding is rarely seen. The clinical manifestation of bleeding in FXI deficiency cases is variable and seems to poorly correlate with plasma FXI levels. The molecular pathology of FXI deficiency is mutation in the F11 gene on the chromosome band 4q35. We report a novel mutation of the F11 gene in an 18-year-old asymptomatic Korean woman with mild FXI deficiency. Pre-operative laboratory screen tests for lipoma on her back revealed slightly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (45.2 sec; reference range, 23.2-39.4 sec). Her FXI activity (35%) was slightly lower than the normal FXI activity (reference range, 50-150%). Direct sequence analysis of the F11 gene revealed a heterozygous A to G substitution in nucleotide 1517 (c.1517A>G) of exon 13, resulting in the substitution of aspartic acid with glycine in codon 506 (p.Asp506Gly). To the best of our knowledge, the Asp506Gly is a novel missense mutation, and this is the first genetically confirmed case of mild FXI deficiency in Korea.

21850008|a|The mutation pattern of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mainland Chinese patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) has been rarely reported, though previous data suggested that the mutation pattern of MELAS could be different among geographically localized populations. We presented the results of comprehensive mtDNA mutation analysis in 92 unrelated Chinese patients with MELAS (85 with classic MELAS and 7 with MELAS/Leigh syndrome (LS) overlap syndrome). The mtDNA A3243G mutation was the most common causal genotype in this patient group (79/92 and 85.9%). The second common gene mutation was G13513A (7/92 and 7.6%). Additionally, we identified T10191C (p.S45P) in ND3, A11470C (p. K237N) in ND4, T13046C (p.M237T) in ND5 and a large-scale deletion (13025-13033:14417-14425) involving partial ND5 and ND6 subunits of complex I in one patient each. Among them, A11470C, T13046C and the single deletion were novel mutations. In summary, patients with mutations affecting mitochondrially encoded complex I (MTND) reached 12.0% (11/92) in this group. It is noteworthy that all seven patients with MELAS/LS overlap syndrome were associated with MTND mutations. Our data emphasize the important role of MTND mutations in the pathogenicity of MELAS, especially MELAS/LS overlap syndrome.

21499297|t|C10ORF97 is a novel tumor-suppressor gene of non-small-cell lung cancer and a functional variant of this gene increases the risk of non-small-cell lung cancer.
21499297|a|In an earlier study we showed that C10ORF97 (chromosome-10, open reading frame-97) was expressed in almost all of the tissues and cell lines tested, and that it inhibited the growth of seven tumor cell lines, including two lung carcinoma cell lines (A549 and PG). Here, we show that C10ORF97 is downregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue compared with normal lung tissue. Overexpression of C10ORF97 significantly suppressed human lung carcinoma A549 cell growth (proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar) and motility (migration and adhesion). This tumor-suppressive function of C10ORF97 was also verified in vivo. We further found that C10ORF97 caused G(1) arrest of A549 cells and modulated the expression level of several cell-cycle regulators (such as CDK2, cyclin-E and p27). These effects of C10ORF97 were mediated by physical association between C10ORF97 and Jun-activating domain-binding protein-1 (JAB1), and blocking of JAB1-mediated translocation of p27 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Together, these results indicated that C10ORF97 functions as a novel tumor suppressor by modulating several key G(1)/S-regulatory proteins by interacting with JAB1. These findings led us to hypothesize that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the C10ORF97 gene that affects its expression might be associated with susceptibility to NSCLC. SNP216 C>T (rs2297882) in the C10ORF97 Kozak sequence was identified, and allele T of SNP216 suppressed C10ORF97 expression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the TT genotype of SNP216 was associated with an increased risk of NSCLC (adjusted odds ratio=1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.33-2.25), P=4.6   10(-5)). These data indicated that C10ORF97 is a tumor suppressor of NSCLC progression and C10ORF97-SNP216 may serve as a predictor of NSCLC.

21695597|t|MHC region and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in African American women.
21695597|a|The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is a key contributor to the genetic basis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although SLE affects African Americans disproportionately compared to European Americans, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the MHC region in relationship to SLE in African Americans. We conducted a screening of the MHC region for 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the deletion of the C4A gene in a SLE case-control study (380 cases, 765 age-matched controls) nested within the prospective Black Women's Health Study. We also genotyped 1,509 ancestral informative markers throughout the genome to estimate European ancestry to control for population stratification due to population admixture. The most strongly associated SNP with SLE was the rs9271366 (odds ratio, OR = 1.70, p = 5.6   10(-5)) near the HLA-DRB1 gene. Conditional haplotype analysis revealed three other SNPs, rs204890 (OR = 1.86, p = 1.2   10(-4)), rs2071349 (OR = 1.53, p = 1.0   10(-3)), and rs2844580 (OR = 1.43, p = 1.3   10(-3)), to be associated with SLE independent of the rs9271366 SNP. In univariate analysis, the OR for the C4A deletion was 1.38, p = 0.075, but after simultaneous adjustment for the other four SNPs the odds ratio was 1.01, p = 0.98. A genotype score combining the four newly identified SNPs showed an additive risk according to the number of high-risk alleles (OR = 1.67 per high-risk allele, p < 0.0001). Our strongest signal, the rs9271366 SNP, was also associated with higher risk of SLE in a previous Chinese genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, two SNPs found in a GWAS of European ancestry women were confirmed in our study, indicating that African Americans share some genetic risk factors for SLE with European and Chinese subjects. In summary, we found four independent signals in the MHC region associated with risk of SLE in African American women.

22048266|t|Exploratory investigation on functional significance of ETS2 and SIM2 genes in Down syndrome.
22048266|a|Trisomy of the 21{st} chromosome leads to an over dosage of several regulatory genes in Down syndrome (DS). Though allelic and genotypic combinations formed between genes are interesting, till date, this particular area has never been explored in DS. In the present investigation four SNPs in two transcription factors, Single minded 2 (SIM2) and V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog2 (ETS2), located in the 21{st} chromosome were genotyped to understand their role in DS. Genomic DNA of eastern Indian probands with DS (N=132), their parents (N=209) and ethnically matched controls (N=149) was subjected to PCR-based analyses of functionally important SNPs followed by statistical analyses. ETS2 rs461155 showed high heterozygosity in DS. Significantly lower frequency of SIM2 C-G haplotype (rs2073601-rs2073416) was noticed in individuals with DS (P value =0.01669) and their fathers (P value=0.01185). Significantly lower frequency of the A-C-C-G with higher frequency of A-C-A-G haplotypes was also noticed in subjects with DS (P value =0.02089 and 0.00588 respectively). Data obtained indicate that the rs2073601 'A' allele, responsible for nonsynonymous substitution of leucine to methionine, may have some role in DS in this population.

22028770|t|APOE genotype-function relationship: evidence of -491 A/T promoter polymorphism modifying transcription control but not type 2 diabetes risk.
22028770|a|BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) coding polymorphism modifies the risks of Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Aside from the coding variants, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the APOE promoter has also been shown to modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we investigate the genotype-function relationship of APOE promoter polymorphism at molecular level and at physiological level: i.e., in transcription control of the gene and in the risk of type 2 diabetes. In molecular studies, the effect of the APOE -491A/T (rs449647) polymorphism on gene transcription was accessed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. The -491 A to T substitution decreased the activity (p<0.05) of the cloned APOE promoter (-1017 to +406). Using the -501 to -481 nucleotide sequence of the APOE promoter as a 'bait' to screen the human brain cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid system yielded ATF4, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response gene, as one of the interacting factors. Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) analyses further substantiated the physical interaction between ATF4 and the APOE promoter. Over-expression of ATF4 stimulated APOE expression whereas siRNA against ATF4 suppressed the expression of the gene. However, interaction between APOE promoter and ATF4 was not -491A/T-specific. At physiological level, the genotype-function relationship of APOE promoter polymorphism was studied in type 2 diabetes. In 630 cases and 595 controls, three APOE promoter SNPs -491A/T, -219G/T (rs405509), and +113G/C (rs440446) were genotyped and tested for association with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese. No SNP or haplotype association with type 2 diabetes was detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: At molecular level, polymorphism -491A/T and ATF4 elicit independent control of APOE gene expression. At physiological level, no genotype-risk association was detected between the studied APOE promoter SNPs and type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese.

21904390|t|Two novel mutations of the PAX6 gene causing different phenotype in a cohort of Chinese patients.
21904390|a|PURPOSE: Aniridia (AN) is a rare congenital panocular disorder caused by the mutations of the paired box homeotic gene 6(PAX6) gene. The PAX6gene is also involved in other anterior segment malformations including Peters anomaly. We studied the PAX6gene mutations in a cohort of affected individuals with different clinical phenotype including AN, coloboma of iris and choroid, or anterior segment malformations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six unrelated families and 10 sporadic patients were examined clinically. After informed consent was obtained, genomic DNA was extracted from the venous blood of all participants. Mutation screening of all exons of the PAX6gene was performed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to detect large deletions. RESULTS: By clinical examination, the patients and the pedigrees were divided into the following three groups: AN, coloboma of iris and choroids, and the anterior segment malformations including peters anomaly. Sequencing of the PAX6gene, three intragenic mutations including a novel heterozygous splicing-site mutations c.357-3C>G (p.Ser119fsX) were identified in the patients of the AN group. A novel missense mutation c.643T>C (p.S216P) was detected in the anterior segment malformation group. The mutation p.S216P located in the homeodomain region of the PAX6 caused the phenotype of Peters anomaly in family A6 with different expressing. Through MLPA analysis, a large deletion including the whole PAX6gene and DKFZ p686k1684gene was detected in one sporadic patient from the AN group. Neither intragenic mutation nor large deletion was identified in the group with coloboma of iris and choroid. CONCLUSION: Our findings further confirmed that different kind of mutations might cause different ocular phenotype, and clearly clinical phenotype classification might increase the mutation detection rate of the PAX6gene.

21496008|t|Screening and cell-based assessment of mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene.
21496008|a|ARX mutations cause a diverse spectrum of human disorders, ranging from severe brain and genital malformations to non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID). ARX is a transcription factor with multiple domains that include four polyalanine (pA) tracts, the first two of which are frequently expanded by mutations. We progressively screened DNA samples from 613 individuals with ID initially for the most frequent ARX mutations (c.304ins(GCG)(7)'expansion' of pA1 and c.429_452dup 'dup24bp' of pA2). Five hundred samples without pA1 or pA2 mutations had the entire ARX ORF screened by single stranded polymorphism conformation (SSCP) and/or denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (dHPLC) analysis. Overall, eight families with six mutations in ARX were identified (1.31%): five duplication mutations in pA2 (0.82%) with three new clinical reports of families with the dup24bp and two duplications larger than the dup24bp mutation discovered (dup27bp, dup33bp); and three point mutations (0.6%), including one novel mutation in the homeodomain (c.1074G>T). Four ultraconserved regions distal to ARX (uc466-469) were also screened in a subset of 94 patients, with three unique nucleotide changes identified in two (uc466, uc467). The subcellular localization of full length ARX proteins was assessed for 11 variants. Protein mislocalization increased as a function of pA2 tract length and phenotypic severity, as has been previously suggested for pA1. Similarly, protein mislocalization of the homeodomain mutations also correlated with clinical severity, suggesting an emerging genotype vs cellular phenotype correlation.

21976953|t|Identification of a novel FBN1 gene mutation in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome.
21976953|a|PURPOSE: To identify the mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome (MFS). METHODS: Patients and family members were given complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of six individuals in the family and 170 healthy Chinese individuals. All of the 65 coding exons and their flanking intronic boundaries of FBN1 were amplified in the proband by polymerase chain reaction and followed by direct sequencing. The mutation identified in the proband was screened in the other family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals by direct sequencing. Protein conservation analysis was performed in six species using an online ClustalW tool. Protein structure was modeled based on the Protein data bank and mutated in DeepView v4.0.1 to predict the functional consequences of the mutation. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous c.3703T>C change in exon 29 of FBN1 was detected in the proband, which resulted in the substitution of serine by proline at codon 1235 (p.S1235P). This mutation was also present in two family members but absent in the other, unaffected family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals. The mutant residue located in the calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like#15 domain is highly conserved among mammalian species and could probably induce conformation change of the domain. CONCLUSIONS: We indentified a novel p.S1235P mutation in FBN1, which is the causative mutation for MFS in this family. Our result expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and contributes to the study of the molecular pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome.

21799811|t|Strong association of 677 C>T substitution in the MTHFR gene with male infertility--a study on an indian population and a meta-analysis.
21799811|a|BACKGROUND: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme of folate and methionine metabolism, making it crucial for DNA synthesis and methylation. The objective of this study was to analyze MTHFR gene 677C>T polymorphism in infertile male individuals from North India, followed by a meta-analysis on our data and published studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook genotyping on a total of 837 individuals including well characterized infertile (N=522) and confirmed fertile (N=315) individuals. The SNP was typed by direct DNA sequencing. Chi square test was done for statistical analysis. Published studies were searched using appropriate keywords. Source of data collection for meta-analysis included 'Pubmed', 'Ovid' and 'Google Scholar'. Those studies analyzing 677C>T polymorphism in male infertility and presenting all relevant data were included in meta-analysis. The genotype data for infertile subjects and fertile controls was extracted from each study. Chi square test was done to obtain odds ratio (OR) and p-value. Meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (Version 2). The frequency of mutant (T) allele (p=0.0025) and genotypes (CT+TT) (p=0.0187) was significantly higher in infertile individuals in comparison to fertile controls in our case-control study. The overall summary estimate (OR) for allele and genotype meta-analysis were 1.304 (p=0.000), 1.310 (p=0.000), respectively, establishing significant association of 677C>T polymorphism with male infertility. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 677C>T substitution associated strongly with male infertility in Indian population. Allele and genotype meta-analysis also supported its strong correlation with male infertility, thus establishing it as a risk factor.

21879313|t|Genotype rs8099917 near the IL28B gene and amino acid substitution at position 70 in the core region of the hepatitis C virus are determinants of serum apolipoprotein B-100 concentration in chronic hepatitis C.
21879313|a|The life cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely related to host lipoprotein metabolism. Serum levels of lipid are associated with the response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, while single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the human interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene locus and amino acid substitutions in the core region of the HCV have been reported to affect the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy in chronic hepatitis with HCV genotype 1b infection. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between serum lipid and factors that are able to predict the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RB therapy, with specific focus on apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) in 148 subjects with chronic HCV G1b infection. Our results demonstrated that both the aa 70 substitution in the core region of the HCV and the rs8099917 SNP located proximal to the IL28B were independent factors in determining serum apoB-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. A significant association was noted between higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 1.1   10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) and the subjects having Arg70. A significant association was also observed between subjects carrying the rs8099917 TT responder genotype and higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 6.4   10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 4.2   10(-3)). Our results suggest that apoB-100 and LDL cholesterol are markers of impaired cellular lipoprotein pathways and/or host endogenous interferon response to HCV in chronic HCV infection. In particular, serum apoB-100 concentration might be an informative marker for judging changes in HCV-associated intracellular lipoprotein metabolism in patients carrying the rs8099917 responder genotype.

20854438|t|SLURP1 mutation-impaired T-cell activation in a family with mal de Meleda.
20854438|a|BACKGROUND: Mal de Meleda (MDM) is palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma with an autosomal recessive inheritance and is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding SLURP-1 (lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1). SLURP-1 is an allosteric agonist to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and it regulates epidermal homeostasis. In addition, murine studies have shown that nAchR signalling is important for the regulation of T-cell function. Among the family members, patients with the homozygous SLURP1 (previously known as ARS component B) mutation are prone to melanoma and viral infection, which might link to defective T-cell function as well as a derangement of epidermal homeostasis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of the SLURP1 gene mutation with T-cell activation in a Taiwanese family with MDM. To test that SLURP-1 is essential for T-cell activation. METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a Taiwanese MDM family bearing the G to A substitution in nucleotide 256 in the SLURP1 gene, corresponding to a glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid 86 (G86R) in the SLURP-1 protein. PBMCs from homozygotes and wild-type controls were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies and the level of T-cell activation was determined by the stimulation index. RESULTS: PBMCs with the heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation had defective T-cell activation. This was restored by the addition of 0  5 ug mL(-1) recombinant human SLURP-1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MDM with the homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation may have an impaired T-cell activation. The presence of wild-type SLURP-1 is essential for normal T-cell activation.

20887110|t|Impact of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphism on neural tube defects.
20887110|a|OBJECT: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common congenital malformations worldwide. Their etiology and exact mechanisms of development are incompletely understood. Many enzymes involved in folate metabolism and the genes encoding these enzymes have been studied as candidates in their etiology. A mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene--a C-->T transition at nucleotide 677--is one among them. The mutation results in substitution of alanine by valine at a functionally important site in the enzyme. It has been shown to be a risk factor for development of NTDs in certain populations. The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of MTHFR 677 C-->T mutation as a risk factor for NTD in the South Indian population and to determine the relative importance of the genotypes in the affected child and its mother. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from the test and the control groups. The test group consisted of children with NTDs and their mothers, while the control group consisted of apparently healthy controls. MTHFR C677T polymorphism in the 3 groups was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism studies. Comparison of polymorphism in the 3 groups was using the chi-square test. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the prevalence of MTHFR 677 C-->T mutation among the 3 groups (p = 0.002). The risk conferred by the TT genotype in the child was statistically significant (OR 12.625, 95% CI 1.430-111.465). In the mothers, however, although there was an increased prevalence of the mutation compared with the control individuals, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.152). CONCLUSIONS: The MTHFR 677TT genotype is considered to be a definite risk factor for development of NTDs. It is the TT genotype status of the developing embryo, rather than the TT genotype status of its mother, that is the critical genetic determinant of MTHFR-related NTD risk.

20602574|t|Bikunin and a1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) gene mutational screening in patients with kidney stones: a case-control study.
20602574|a|OBJECTIVE: Bikunin is an inhibitor of kidney stone formation synthesized in the liver together with a(1)-microglobulin from the a(1)-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) gene. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between bikunin/AMBP gene polymorphisms and urinary stone formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To analyse the DNA, blood samples were taken from 75 kidney stone formers who had a familial stone history, 35 sporadic stone formers and 101 healthy individuals. Four exons of bikunin gene and five parts of the promoter region of the AMBP gene were screened using single-strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis. RESULTS: The Init-2 region of the promoter of AMBP gene had polymorphisms at positions -218 and -189 nt giving three different genotypes having 1,3, 2,4 and 1,2,3,4 alleles with frequencies of 17.06%, 60.19% and 22.75%, respectively, in all groups. Therefore, the Init-2 region appears to be polymorphic. As a result, the 1,3 allele has -218G and -189T complying with the reference database sequence, the 2,4 allele has -218G and T-189C substitution and the allele 1,2,3,4 genotype has substitutions at positions G-218C and T-189C. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in allele distribution between patients and controls. These common alleles exist in the Turkish population independent of stone formation. These results are the first to demonstrate the existence of bikunin and AMBP promoter polymorphism. Although the Init-2 region of the AMBP gene is the binding site for various transcription factors, the results showed no association between these observed genotypes and stone-forming phenotypes.

21080147|t|Novel CRELD1 gene mutations in patients with atrioventricular septal defect.
21080147|a|BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) occur as clinical defects of several different syndromes, as autosomal dominant defects, and as sporadically occurring malformations. Consequently, there is genetic heterogeneity, but until recently, little is known about the genes involving in the pathogenesis of AVSD. CRELD1 gene, a novel cell adhesion molecule, is a candidate gene for AVSD. METHODS: This study included 133 patients with AVSD and 200 healthy controls. Peripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted from the leukocytes. CRELD1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers. The sequences of PCR products were compared between the patients and controls. RESULTS: In a patient, a C-to-G transition was identified at nucleotide 857 in exon 8 that resulted in a substitution of alanine for proline at amino acid 286 in the first calcium-binding EGF domain. This patient had an isolated partial AVSD and the mutation was inherited from her mother. Another mutation was detected in a patient with a partial AVSD and evidence of Down syndrome. The heterozygous c.973G>A transition in exon 9 resulted in a substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at amino acid 325 (E325K) in the second calcium-binding EGF domain. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel CRELD1 mutations were identified in the calcium-binding EGF domain in patients with AVSD. CRELD1 is likely to be an AVSD-susceptibility gene and CRELD1 mutations may increase the risk of developing a heart defect rather than being a direct causative mutation.

20708777|t|Association of DNA polymorphisms within the CYP11B2/CYP11B1 locus and postoperative hypertension risk in the patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas.
20708777|a|OBJECTIVES: Hypertension often persists after adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism. Traditional factors associated with postoperative hypertension were evaluated, but whether genetic determinants were involved remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of DNA polymorphisms within steroid synthesis genes (CYP11B2, CYP11B1) and the postoperative resolution of hypertension in Chinese patients undergoing adrenalectomy for aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA). METHODS: Ninety-three patients with APA were assessed for postoperative resolution of hypertension. All patients were genotyped for rs1799998 (C-344 T), intron 2 conversion, rs4539 (A2718G) within CYP11B2 and rs6410 (G22 5A), rs6387 (A2803G) within CYP11B1. The associations between CYPB11B2/CYP11B1 polymorphisms and persistent postoperative hypertension were assessed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: CYP11B2-CYP11B1 haplotype was associated with persistent postoperative hypertension in Chinese patients undergoing adrenalectomy with APA (P = .006). Specifically, the rs4539 (AA) polymorphism was associated with persistent postoperative hypertension (P = .002). Multivariate logistic regression revealed the common haplotypes H1 (AGACT), H2 (AGAWT), and H3 (AGAWC) were associated with the persistent postoperative hypertension (P = .01, 0.03, 0.005 after Bonferroni correction). Additional predictors of persistent postoperative hypertension included duration of hypertension (P <.0005), family history of hypertension (P = .001), and elevated systolic blood pressure (P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: The rs4539 (AA), H1, H2, and H3 are genetic predictors for postoperative persistence of hypertension for Chinese patients treated by adrenalectomy with APA. DNA polymorphisms at CYP11B2/B1 locus may confer susceptibility to postoperative hypertension of patients with APA.

20806042|t|A novel mutation in GJA8 causing congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome in a Chinese pedigree.
20806042|a|PURPOSE: To identify the underlying genetic defect in a four-generation family of Chinese origin with autosomal dominant congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC). METHODS: All individuals in the study underwent a full clinical examination and the details of history were collected . Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and the exons of all candidate genes were sequenced. RESULTS: Direct sequencing of the encoding regions of the candidate genes revealed a heterozygous mutation c.592C-->T in exon 2 of the gap junction protein, alpha 8 (GJA8) gene. This mutation was responsible for the familial disorder through the substitution of a highly conserved arginine to tryptophan at codon 198 (p.R198W). This change co-segregated with all affected members of the family, but was not detected either in the non-carrier relatives or in the 100 normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first to relate p.R198W mutation in GJA8 with CCMC. The result expands the mutation spectrum of GJA8 in associated with congenital cataract and microcornea, and implies that this gene has direct involvement with the development of the lens as well as the other anterior segment of the eye.

20949073|t|Alternative splicing at a NAGNAG acceptor site as a novel phenotype modifier.
20949073|a|Approximately 30% of alleles causing genetic disorders generate premature termination codons (PTCs), which are usually associated with severe phenotypes. However, bypassing the deleterious stop codon can lead to a mild disease outcome. Splicing at NAGNAG tandem splice sites has been reported to result in insertion or deletion (indel) of three nucleotides. We identified such a mechanism as the origin of the mild to asymptomatic phenotype observed in cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the E831X mutation (2623G>T) in the CFTR gene. Analyses performed on nasal epithelial cell mRNA detected three distinct isoforms, a considerably more complex situation than expected for a single nucleotide substitution. Structure-function studies and in silico analyses provided the first experimental evidence of an indel of a stop codon by alternative splicing at a NAGNAG acceptor site. In addition to contributing to proteome plasticity, alternative splicing at a NAGNAG tandem site can thus remove a disease-causing UAG stop codon. This molecular study reveals a naturally occurring mechanism where the effect of either modifier genes or epigenetic factors could be suspected. This finding is of importance for genetic counseling as well as for deciding appropriate therapeutic strategies.

20534762|t|Two novel mutations of the TSH-beta subunit gene underlying congenital central hypothyroidism undetectable in neonatal TSH screening.
20534762|a|CONTEXT: Patients with TSH-beta subunit defects and congenital hypothyroidism are missed by TSH-based neonatal screening. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report the molecular consequences of a novel splice-junction mutation and a novel missense mutation in the TSH-beta subunit gene found in two patients with congenital central hypothyroidism and conventional treatment-resistant anemia. RESULTS: Patient 1 had a homozygous G to A nucleotide change at the 5' donor splice site of exon/intron 2. This resulted in a silent change at codon 34 of the mature protein. In vitro splicing assays showed that the mutant minigene dramatically affected pre-mRNA processing, causing exon 2 to be completely skipped. The putative product from a new out-of-frame translational start point in exon 3 is expected to yield a nonsense 25-amino-acid peptide. In patient 2, sequence analysis revealed a compound heterozygosis for the already reported 313delT (C105Vfs114X) mutation and for a second novel mutation in exon 3, substituting G for A at cDNA nucleotide position 323, resulting in a C88Y change. This cysteine residue is conserved among all dimeric pituitary and placental glycoprotein hormone-beta subunits. Data from in silico analysis confirmed that the C88Y mutation would affect subunit conformation. Indeed, two different bioinformatics approaches, PolyPhen and SIFT analysis, predicted C88Y to be a damaging substitution. CONCLUSIONS: In isolated TSH deficiency, the exact molecular diagnosis is mandatory for diagnosis of isolated pituitary deficiency, delineation of prognosis, and genetic counseling. Moreover, diagnosis of central hypothyroidism should be considered in the face of severe infant anemia of uncertain etiology.

20529581|t|A novel point mutation in CD18 causing leukocyte adhesion deficiency in a Chinese patient.
20529581|a|BACKGROUND: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD-1) is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited immunodeficiency disease characterized by recurrent severe bacterial infection, impaired pus formation, poor wound healing, associated with the mutation in the CD18 gene responsible for the ability of the leucocytes to migrate from the blood stream towards the site of inflammation. Correct and early diagnosis of LAD-1 is vital to the success of treatment and prevention of aggressive infections. The purpose of this study was to collect the clinical findings of the disease and to identify the genetic entity. METHODS: CD18 expression in the peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient, his parents and normal control was measured with flow cytometry. The entire coding regions of the CD18 gene were screened with direct sequencing genomic DNA. RESULTS: CD18 expression level on this patient's leukocyte surface was significantly decreased, with normal level in control group, his father and mother. Gene analysis revealed that this patient had a homozygous c.899A > T missense mutation in exon 8 of CD18 gene, causing the substitution of Asp to Val at the 300 amino acid. His parents were both heterozygous carriers while no such mutation was found in 50 normal controls. CONCLUSION: This study disclosed a novel point mutation Asp 300 Val located in a highly conserved region (HCR) of CD18 and confirmed the heterogeneity of the mutations causing LAD-1, indicating it was quite beneficial to establish correct and early diagnosis in children with severe LAD-1.

20523265|t|Association study of complement factor H, C2, CFB, and C3 and age-related macular degeneration in a Han Chinese population.
20523265|a|PURPOSE: Genes in the complement pathway, including complement factor H (CFH), C2/BF, and C3, have been reported to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Genetic variants, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in these genes were geno-typed for a case-control association study in a mainland Han Chinese population. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-eight patients with wet AMD, 80 patients with soft drusen, and 220 matched control subjects were recruited among Han Chinese in mainland China. Seven SNPs in CFH and two SNPs in C2, CFB', and C3 were genotyped using the ABI SNaPshot method. A deletion of 84,682 base pairs covering the CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes was detected by direct polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Four SNPs, including rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514), and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), in CFH showed a significant association with wet AMD in the cohort of this study. A haplotype containing these four SNPs (CATA) significantly increased protection of wet AMD with a P value of 0.0005 and an odds ratio of 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.60). Unlike in other populations, rs2274700 and rs1410996 did not show a significant association with AMD in the Chinese population of this study. None of the SNPs in CFH showed a significant association with drusen, and none of the SNPs in CFH, C2, CFB, and C3 showed a significant association with either wet AMD or drusen in the cohort of this study. The CFHR1 and CFHR3 deletion was not polymorphic in the Chinese population and was not associated with wet AMD or drusen. CONCLUSION: This study showed that SNPs rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514), and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), but not rs7535263, rs1410996, or rs2274700, in CFH were significantly associated with wet AMD in a mainland Han Chinese population. This study showed that CFH was more likely to be AMD susceptibility gene at Chr.1q31 based on the finding that the CFHR1 and CFHR3 deletion was not polymorphic in the cohort of this study, and none of the SNPs that were significantly associated with AMD in a white population in C2, CFB, and C3 genes showed a significant association with AMD.

20005218|t|A potential regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of the Klotho gene may be associated with essential hypertension in the Chinese Han population.
20005218|a|BACKGROUND: Mice with defects in the Klotho gene exhibit multiple aging phenotypes including arteriosclerosis. We hypothesised that the G-395A polymorphism in the promoter region of the human Klotho gene may contribute to the prevalence of Essential Hypertension (EH). METHODS: We investigate whether the G-395A polymorphism of Klotho is associated with EH in a population consisting of 215 patients with EH and 220 non-hypertensive subjects. We also tested whether a G/A substitution at the G-395A site affected the transcription level in vitro through the dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Differences in the genotype distributions of the G-395A polymorphism between the EH and non-hypertension groups are statistically significant (P=0.032). There are differential effects of age, gender and smoking status on the association of the G-395A polymorphism with EH; the G-395A polymorphism is significantly associated with EH in subjects over 60years old, in females and in nonsmokers. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds ratio for EH in the -395A allele carriers as compared with the control group was 0.593 (P=0.024) after adjusting for current traditional risk factors. The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that the -395A carrier of a 498-bp DNA fragment (containing the G-395A site) upstream of the Klotho gene has higher relative luciferase activity than the -395G carrier. CONCLUSIONS: The G-395A polymorphism of the human Klotho gene is associated with EH and may be a potential regulatory site.

19897031|t|An intronic polymorphism of IRF4 gene influences gene transcription in vitro and shows a risk association with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in males.
19897031|a|The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of DNA-binding proteins regulates expression of interferon-inducible genes with roles in the immune response and carcinogenesis. IRF4 is involved in the differentiation of B and T cells and is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies as a result of c-REL (NF-kappaB) hyperactivation. IRF4 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We examined 13 IRF4 SNPs in 114 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 388 newborn controls from Wales (U.K.) using TaqMan assays. IRF4 intron 4 SNP rs12203592 showed a male-specific risk association (OR=4.4, 95% CI=1.5 to 12.6, P=0.007). Functional consequences of the C>T substitution at this SNP were assessed by cell-based reporter assays using three different cell lines. We found a repressive effect of the rs12203592 wildtype allele C on IRF4 promoter activity (P<0.001) but no repression by the variant allele in any cell line tested. Thus, homozygosity for the rs12203592 variant allele would result in increased IRF4 expression. This increase would be compounded by high levels of NF-kappaB activity in males due to the absence of estrogen. IRF4 differs from other IRFs in its anti-interferon activity which interferes with immune surveillance. We propose that a detailed study of IRF4 can provide information on the mechanism of the sex effect and the role of immune surveillance in childhood ALL development.

19766614|t|A novel insertion mutation in the SEDL gene results in X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda in a large Chinese pedigree.
19766614|a|BACKGROUND: Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT) is an X-chromosome linked primary skeletal dysplasia characterized by a disproportionate short-trunked short stature, dysplasia of the large joints and flattened thoracic and lumber vertebral bodies. The objective of this study is to describe a large Chinese SEDT family with a milder phenotype and describe the molecular and clinical findings. METHODS: Eight affected males of the family were diagnosed with SEDT according to their clinical and radiological features. Direct DNA sequencing of the SEDL gene was performed. RT-PCR experiments on total RNA from blood lymphocytes were performed to confirm the defect on the SEDL gene. A short summary of all currently known SEDL gene mutations is presented. RESULTS: DNA sequencing revealed that all the affected males carried an insertion mutation (c.370-371insA) unreported previously, predicted to result in frameshifts and generate a premature stop codon (p.S124fsX127). The identical mutation was also observed in a 10-year old presymptomatic boy of the family. Eight female carriers had the typical sequencing chromatograms of heterozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the novel insertion mutation (c.370-371insA) in this SEDT family enables carrier detection and presymptomatic/prenatal diagnosis, but also the detailed molecular and clinical features will be useful for extending the evidence for genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in SEDT.

19681861|t|Forty-two novel COL7A1 mutations and the role of a frequent single nucleotide polymorphism in the MMP1 promoter in modulation of disease severity in a large European dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa cohort.
19681861|a|BACKGROUND: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a severe genetic skin blistering disorder caused by mutations in the gene COL7A1, encoding collagen VII. Recently, the MMP1 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1799750, designated as 1G 2G, was shown to be involved in modulation of disease severity in patients with recessive DEB (RDEB), and was proposed as a genetic modifier. OBJECTIVES: To identify the molecular basis of DEB in 103 individuals and to replicate the results of the MMP1 promoter SNP analysis in an independent patient group, as verification is necessary in such a rare and heterogeneous disorder. METHODS: To determine the molecular basis of the disease, we performed COL7A1 mutation screening, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR. The status of the MMP1 SNP was analysed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion and verified by sequencing. RESULTS: We disclosed 42 novel COL7A1 mutations, including the first large genomic deletion of 4 kb affecting only the COL7A1 gene, and three apparently silent mutations affecting splicing. Even though the frequency of the high-risk allele was increased in patients with RDEB, no statistically significant correlation between disease severity and genotype could be made. Also, no correlation was observed with development of squamous cell carcinoma, a severe complication of DEB. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results suggest that the MMP1 SNP is not the sole disease modifier in different forms of DEB, and other genetic and environmental factors contribute to the clinical phenotype.

19559455|t|A combination of defective DNA and protective host factors are found in a set of HIV-1 ancestral LTNPs.
19559455|a|We studied viral evolution in three HIV-1 ancestral patients from a group of LTNPs; although some minor sequences showing viral evolution were detected in all patients, the extremely low viral evolution of their viruses was shown by the phylogenetic analysis of the env sequences. Complete nucleotide sequencing of viral DNA showed the major presence of deletions. In two patients, deletions of 1088 and 228 nucleotides mapped to 5' LTR-gag region; in the other, a 247 nucleotide deletion was positioned in pol gene up to the vif ORF. These deleted genomes became dominant during follow up. Patient's viruses displayed 13 common mutations in conserved residues, from the 5' LTR to the nef gene. These mutations provided evidence of a common origin. Regarding host characteristics, one patient had HLA B2705/B5801; another B1402/B5701; whereas a third showed B3901/B4402 and was Delta32-CCR5 heterozygous. These HIV controllers presented a combination of deleted viral genomes and host protective factors.

19444361|t|COL3A1 2209G>A is a predictor of pelvic organ prolapse.
19444361|a|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: A familial tendency has been demonstrated in the etiology of pelvic organ prolapse (POP), but the specific genetic defects have not been identified. Type III collagen is an important factor in the repair of connective tissue, and gene polymorphisms may impair the tensile strength. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the alpha I chain of the type III collagen protein-encoding gene (COL3A1) pose women at risk for POP. METHODS: In this case-control study, the prevalence of type III collagen polymorphisms was compared in women with and without signs and symptoms of POP. RESULTS: Two hundred and two POP patients and 102 normal parous controls were included. A homozygous single-nucleotide substitution in the coding region of type III collagen (COL3A1 2209G>A, rs1800255) was identified in 27 (13%) POP patients and three (3%) controls (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-17.1). CONCLUSIONS: The probability of POP was higher in women with COL3A1 2209G>A. This polymorphism showed to be a relevant risk factor for POP.

19429807|t|A novel ATP7A gross deletion mutation in a Korean patient with Menkes disease.
19429807|a|Menkes disease (MD, MIM 309400) is a fatal X-linked recessive disorder that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP7A, a copper-transporting, P-type ATPase. Patients with MD are characterized by progressive hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive, and death in early childhood. Two Korean patients were diagnosed with Menkes disease by clinical and biochemical findings. We found one missense mutation and one gross deletion in the ATP7A gene in the patients. The missense mutation in Patient 1, c.3943G>A (p.G1315R) in exon 20, was identified in a previous report. Patient 2 had a gross deletion of c.1544-?_2916+?, which was a novel mutation. The patients' mothers were shown to be carriers of the respective mutations. Prenatal DNA diagnosis in the family of Patient 2 was successfully performed, showing a male fetus with the wild-type genotype. The gross deletion is the first mutation to be identified in the ATP7A gene in Korean MD patients. We expect that our findings will be helpful in understanding the wide range of genetic variation in ATP7A in Korean MD patients.

This new DGUOK homozygous mutation (c.444-62C>A) was identified in three patients from two North-African consanguineous families with combined respiratory chain deficiencies and mitochondrial DNA depletion in the liver. Brain MRIs are normal in DGUOK patients in the literature. Interestingly, we found subtentorial abnormal myelination and moderate hyperintensity in the bilateral pallidi in our patients. This new mutation creates a cryptic splice site in intron 3 (in position -62) and is predicted to result in a larger protein with an in-frame insertion of 20 amino acids. In silico analysis of the putative impact of the insertion shows serious clashes in protein conformation: this insertion disrupts the alpha5 helix of the dGK kinase domain, rendering the protein unable to bind purine deoxyribonucleosides. In addition, a common haplotype that segregated with the disease in both families was detected by haplotype reconstruction with 10 markers (microsatellites and SNPs), which span 4.6 Mb of DNA covering the DGUOK locus. In conclusion, we report a new DGUOK splice site mutation that provide insight into a critical protein domain (dGK kinase domain) and the first founder mutation in a North-African population.

19365571|t|Macular corneal dystrophy in a Chinese family related with novel mutations of CHST6.
19365571|a|PURPOSE: To identify mutations in the carbohydrate sulfotransferase gene (CHST6) for a Chinese family with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) and to investigate the histopathological changes in the affected cornea. METHODS: A corneal button of the proband was obtained by penetrating keratoplasty. The half button and ultrathin sections from the other half button were examined with special stains under a light microscope (LM) and an electron microscope (EM) separately. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 11 family members, and the coding region of CHST6 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS: The positive reaction to colloidal iron stain (extracellular blue accumulations in the stroma) was detected under light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles. The compound heterozygous mutations, c.892C>T and c.1072T>C, were identified in exon 3 of CHST6 in three patients. The two transversions resulted in the substitution of a stop codon for glutamine at codon 298 (p.Q298X) and a missense mutation at codon 358, tyrosine to histidine (p.Y358H). The six unaffected family individuals carried alternative heterozygous mutations. These two mutations were not detected in any of the 100 control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Those novel compound heterozygous mutations were thought to contribute to the loss of CHST6 function, which induced the abnormal metabolism of keratan sulfate (KS) that deposited in the corneal stroma. It could be proved by the observation of a positive stain reaction and the enlarged collagen fibers as well as hyperplastic fibroblasts under microscopes.

19298002|t|Genetic polymorphism in chemokine CCL22 and susceptibility to Helicobacter pylori infection-related gastric carcinoma.
19298002|a|BACKGROUND: Gastric carcinoma is widely considered to be related to Helicobacter pylori infection, and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 22 (CCL22) plays an important role in suppressing immune responses against H. pylori and tumor cells. In this study, the authors examined the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CCL22 gene and the risk of gastric carcinoma. METHODS: Information on SNPs in the CCL22 coding region was obtained from the HapMap Project database. Genotypes were determined in a case-control cohort that consisted of 1001 patients with gastric carcinoma and 1066 controls, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed by using a logistic regression model. Serum H. pylori antibody levels were measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The 16C-->A SNP (reference SNP no. 4359426) in exon 1 of the CCL22 gene, which causes a 2 aspartate (2Asp) to 2 alanine (2Ala) substitution in the CCL22 protein, was associated with a significantly increased risk of gastric carcinoma. Individuals who were homozygous for the Ala/Ala genotype had an OR of 2.27 (95% CI, 1.28-4.02) compared with individuals who had the Asp/Asp genotype. Stratification analysis indicated that the association was more pronounced among men (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.29-5.41) and among younger individuals (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.36-5.96) compared with women and older individuals. Moreover, a multiplicative joint effect between the CCL22 SNP and H. pylori infection that intensified the risk was observed (OR for the presence of both Ala/Ala genotype and H. pylori infection, 18.37; 95% CI, 2.30-146.67). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggested that the CCL22 polymorphism is associated with an increase risk of developing H. pylori infection-related gastric carcinoma.

19129715|t|Three novel IGFALS gene mutations resulting in total ALS and severe circulating IGF-I/IGFBP-3 deficiency in children of different ethnic origins.
19129715|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: To date, four mutations in the IGFALS gene have been reported. We now describe two children of different ethnic background with total acid-labile subunit (ALS) and severe circulating IGF-I/IGFBP-3 deficiencies resulting from three novel mutations in the IGFALS gene. PATIENTS/METHODS: Serum and DNA of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Case 1 is a 12-year-old boy of Mayan origin. Case 2 is a 5-year-old girl of Jewish/Eastern European (Polish, Russian, Austrian-Hungarian)/Icelandic/European (French, English) ancestry. The reported cases had moderate short stature (-2.91 and -2.14 SDS, respectively), nondetectable serum ALS and extremely low serum concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. Case 1 harbored a novel homozygous 1308_1316 dup9 mutation in a highly conserved leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 17 motif of exon 2, representing an in-frame insertion of 3 amino acids, LEL. Case 2 harbored a novel heterozygous C60S/L244F mutation in exon 2, located within a highly conserved LRR 1 and LRR 9, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of additional novel IGFALS mutations, resulting in severe IGF-I/IGFBP-3 and ALS deficiencies, supports IGFALS as a candidate gene of the GH/IGF system, implicated in the pathogenesis of primary IGF deficiency, and represents an important part of its differential diagnosis.

19110214|t|A recessive skeletal dysplasia, SEMD aggrecan type, results from a missense mutation affecting the C-type lectin domain of aggrecan.
19110214|a|Analysis of a nuclear family with three affected offspring identified an autosomal-recessive form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia characterized by severe short stature and a unique constellation of radiographic findings. Homozygosity for a haplotype that was identical by descent between two of the affected individuals identified a locus for the disease gene within a 17.4 Mb interval on chromosome 15, a region containing 296 genes. These genes were assessed and ranked by cartilage selectivity with whole-genome microarray data, revealing only two genes, encoding aggrecan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, that were selectively expressed in cartilage. Sequence analysis of aggrecan complementary DNA from an affected individual revealed homozygosity for a missense mutation (c.6799G --> A) that predicts a p.D2267N amino acid substitution in the C-type lectin domain within the G3 domain of aggrecan. The D2267 residue is predicted to coordinate binding of a calcium ion, which influences the conformational binding loops of the C-type lectin domain that mediate interactions with tenascins and other extracellular-matrix proteins. Expression of the normal and mutant G3 domains in mammalian cells showed that the mutation created a functional N-glycosylation site but did not adversely affect protein trafficking and secretion. Surface-plasmon-resonance studies showed that the mutation influenced the binding and kinetics of the interactions between the aggrecan G3 domain and tenascin-C. These findings identify an autosomal-recessive skeletal dysplasia and a significant role for the aggrecan C-type lectin domain in regulating endochondral ossification and, thereby, height.

19082493|t|Combination of polymorphisms within 5' and 3' untranslated regions of thymidylate synthase gene modulates survival in 5 fluorouracil-treated colorectal cancer patients.
19082493|a|In the present study we explored the effect of three polymorphisms of the TS gene on overall and progression- free survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients subjected to 5FU chemotherapy. A 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), a G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and a deletion of 6 bp at position 1494 were studied. The possible combined effect of these DNA polymorphisms on the clinical outcome of patients was also evaluated. A retrospective study was carried out on paraffin-embedded sections from 113 patients diagnosed of advanced CRC. TS genotyping methods were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VNTR and PCR, followed by restriction length fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for SNP and ins/del 6 bp. To study the combined effect of TS polymorphisms, four categories were defined accordingly to the level of expression attributed to SNP and ins/del 6 bp genotypes: C_allele 6-, C_6+/6+, G_allele6- and G_6+/6+. VNTR and ins/del 6 bp genotypes varied with tumour anatomical site: 2R/2R genotype was rare in left-sided tumours (7.0% vs. 26.3% of right-sided and 24.1% of rectal cancers; P<0.01), where the variant allele 6- was very frequent (69.0%). Instead, most patients with right-sided tumours were wild-type homozygous 6+/6+ (63.9%) (P<0.01). Heterozygous 6+/6- genotype was more frequent among tumours classified as C (50.0%) and D (76.5%) Dukes stages (P=0.05). None of the studied polymorphisms alone affected overall or progression-free survival (PFS). C_6+/6+ and G_6+/6+ combined genotypes were respectively associated to the best and worst PFS (P=0.03 when compared with each other), while combinations carrying the allele 6- determined an intermediate evolution that might be indicative of a variable response to chemotherapy. The rate of Dukes B stage tumours was unexpectedly high (59.1%) among patients with the unfavourable G_6+/6+ combination. In our study the combination of high TS expression genotypes G_6+/6+ identifies a group of high risk within CRC patients treated with 5FU.

19012332|t|Somatic TP53 mutation mosaicism in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
19012332|a|We present a girl who developed adrenocortical adenoma at the age of 1 year and osteosarcoma at the age of 5 years. There was no history of cancer in her parents and their relatives. However, both tumors were typical for the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and the patient met criteria for germline TP53 mutation testing. A mutation in codon 282 (Arg282Trp) was identified in her blood lymphocyte genomic DNA. The substitution was found in neither of her parents, which indicated a possibility of a de novo mutation. Unexpectedly, sequencing of the DNA of the patient repeatedly showed allelic imbalance in favor of the normal allele. This observation prompted us to investigate the putative somatic mosaicism in the patient consisting of normal cells and cells heterozygous for the mutation. The imbalance was also examined in two other non-invasively sampled tissues, buccal cells, and cells from the urine sediment, and sequencing was confirmed with two other independent methods. While the findings in blood and the urine sediment were similar, in buccal cells both alleles were present in equal amounts. The allele ratio in lymphocytes was consistent with a mosaic where about 2/3 of cells carried two normal alleles and only 1/3 was heterozygous for the mutation. Despite the mosaicism the girl developed two early childhood tumors of mesodermal origin, and her phenotype was thus not milder than that of other germline TP53 mutation carriers. To our knowledge this is the first description of somatic mosaicism for a de novo TP53 mutation in LFS.

18827003|t|A novel point mutation in the amino terminal domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene enhancing hGR-mediated gene expression.
18827003|a|CONTEXT: Interindividual variations in glucocorticoid sensitivity have been associated with manifestations of cortisol excess or deficiency and may be partly explained by polymorphisms in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene. We studied a 43-yr-old female, who presented with manifestations consistent with tissue-selective glucocorticoid hypersensitivity. We detected a novel, single, heterozygous nucleotide (G --> C) substitution at position 1201 (exon 2) of the hGR gene, which resulted in aspartic acid to histidine substitution at amino acid position 401 in the amino-terminal domain of the hGRalpha. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of action of the natural mutant receptor hGRalphaD401H. METHODS-RESULTS: Compared with the wild-type hGRalpha, the mutant receptor hGRalphaD401H demonstrated a 2.4-fold increase in its ability to transactivate the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in response to dexamethasone but had similar affinity for the ligand (dissociation constant = 6.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.6 nm) and time to nuclear translocation (14.75 +/- 0.25 vs. 14.25 +/- 1.13 min). The mutant receptor hGRalphaD401H did not exert a dominant positive or negative effect upon the wild-type receptor, it preserved its ability to bind to glucocorticoid response elements, and displayed a normal interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 coactivator. CONCLUSIONS: The mutant receptor hGRalphaD401H enhances the transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. The presence of the D401H mutation may predispose subjects to obesity, hypertension, and other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.

18813858|t|Novel mutations in the IRF6 gene in Brazilian families with Van der Woude syndrome.
18813858|a|Van der Woude Syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal craniofacial disorder characterized by lower lip pits and cleft lip and/or palate. Mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene have been identified in patients with VWS. To identify novel IRF6 mutations in patients affected by VWS, we screened 2 Brazilian families, sequencing the entire IRF6-coding region and flanking intronic boundaries. Two novel heterozygous mutations were identified: a frame shift mutation with deletion of G at the nucleotide position 520 in the exon 6 (520delG), and a missense single nucleotide substitution from T to A at nucleotide position 1135 in exon 8 (T1135A). By using restriction enzyme analysis, we were able to demonstrate the lack of similar mutations in unrelated healthy individuals and non-syndromic cleft lip and palate patients. Our results further confirmed that haploinsufficiency of the IRF6 gene results in VWS.

18806880|t|Genetics of Meesmann corneal dystrophy: a novel mutation in the keratin 3 gene in an asymptomatic family suggests genotype-phenotype correlation.
18806880|a|PURPOSE: Juvenile epithelial corneal dystrophy of Meesmann (MCD, OMIM 122100) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by fragility of the anterior corneal epithelium and intraepithelial microcyst formation. Although the disease is generally mild and affected individuals are often asymptomatic, some suffer from recurrent erosions leading to lacrimation, photophobia, and deterioration in visual acuity. MCD is caused by mutations in keratin 3 (KRT3) or keratin 12 (KRT12) genes, which encode cornea-specific cytoskeletal proteins. Seventeen mutations in KRT12 and two in KRT3 have been described so far. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic background of MCD in a Polish family. METHODS: We report on a three-generation family with MCD. Epithelial lesions characteristic for MCD were visualized with slit-lamp examination and confirmed by in vivo confocal microscopy. Using genomic DNA as a template, all coding regions of KRT3 and KRT12 were amplified and sequenced. Presence of the mutation was verified with restriction endonuclease digestion. RESULTS: In the proband, direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product from amplified coding regions of KRT3 and KRT12 revealed a novel 1493A>T heterozygous missense mutation in exon 7 of KRT3, which predicts the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at codon 498 (E498V). Using PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, the mutation was demonstrated to segregate with the disease (four affected members, three non-affected) and to be absent in 100 controls from the Polish population, indicating that it is not a common polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: Location of the E498V mutation emphasizes the functional relevance of the highly conserved boundary motifs at the COOH-terminus of the alpha-helical rod domain in keratin 3 (K3).

18779591|t|Identification of a gain-of-function mutation of the prolactin receptor in women with benign breast tumors.
18779591|a|There is currently no known genetic disease linked to prolactin (Prl) or its receptor (PrlR) in humans. Given the essential role of this hormonal system in breast physiology, we reasoned that genetic anomalies of Prl/PrlR genes may be related to the occurrence of breast diseases with high proliferative potential. Multiple fibroadenomas (MFA) are benign breast tumors which appear most frequently in young women, including at puberty, when Prl has well-recognized proliferative actions on the breast. In a prospective study involving 74 MFA patients and 170 control subjects, we identified four patients harboring a heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 6 of the PrlR gene, encoding Ile(146)-->Leu substitution in its extracellular domain. This sole substitution was sufficient to confer constitutive activity to the receptor variant (PrlR(I146L)), as assessed in three reconstituted cell models (Ba/F3, HEK293 and MCF-7 cells) by Prl-independent (i) PrlR tyrosine phosphorylation, (ii) activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling, (iii) transcriptional activity toward a Prl-responsive reporter gene, and (iv) cell proliferation and protection from cell death. Constitutive activity of PrlR(I146L) in the breast sample from a patient was supported by increased STAT5 signaling. This is a unique description of a functional mutation of the PrlR associated with a human disease. Hallmarks of constitutive activity were all reversed by a specific PrlR antagonist, which opens potential therapeutic approaches for MFA, or any other disease that could be associated with this mutation in future.

18385169|t|TNFA -308G>A in two international population-based cohorts and risk of asthma.
18385169|a|Genetic association studies have related the tumour necrosis factor-alpha gene (TNFA) guanine to adenine substitution of nucleotide -308 (-308G>A) polymorphism to increased risk of asthma, but results are inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to test whether two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, of TNFA and of the lymphotoxin-alpha gene (LTA), are associated with asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy in adults, by combining the results of two large population-based multicentric studies and conducting a meta-analysis of previously published studies. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) and Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) used comparable protocols, including questionnaires for respiratory symptoms and measures of lung function and atopy. DNA samples from 11,136 participants were genotyped at TNFA -308 and LTA 252. Logistic regression employing fixed and random effects models and nonparametric techniques were used. The prevalence of asthma was 6%. The TNFA -308G>A polymorphism was associated with increased asthma prevalence and with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. No consistent association was found for atopy. The LTA 252A>G polymorphism was not associated with any of the outcomes. A meta-analysis of 17 studies showed an increased asthma risk for the TNFA -308 adenine allele. The tumour necrosis factor-alpha gene nucleotide -308 polymorphism is associated with a moderately increased risk of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, but not with atopy. These results are supported by a meta-analysis of previously published studies.

18272172|t|A splice site mutation in hERG leads to cryptic splicing in human long QT syndrome.
18272172|a|Mutations in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) cause type 2 long QT syndrome. In this study, we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of the hERG splice site mutation 2398+1G>C and the genotype-phenotype relationship of mutation carriers in three unrelated kindreds with long QT syndrome. The effect of 2398+1G>C on mRNA splicing was studied by analysis of RNA isolated from lymphocytes of index patients and using minigenes expressed in HEK293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the 2398+1G>C mutation disrupted the normal splicing and activated a cryptic splice donor site in intron 9, leading to the inclusion of 54 nt of the intron 9 sequence in hERG mRNA. The cryptic splicing resulted in an in-frame insertion of 18 amino acids in the middle of the cyclic nucleotide binding domain. In patch clamp experiments the splice mutant did not generate hERG current. Western blot and immunostaining studies showed that the mutant expressed an immature form of hERG protein that failed to reach the plasma membrane. Coexpression of the mutant and wild-type channels led to a dominant negative suppression of wild-type channel function by intracellular retention of heteromeric channels. Our results demonstrate that 2398+1G>C activates a cryptic site and generates a full-length hERG protein with an insertion of 18 amino acids, which leads to a trafficking defect of the mutant channel.

18270997|t|Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene variants: possible association of the Val158Met variant with opiate addiction in Hispanic women.
18270997|a|Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the breakdown of catechol neurotransmitters, including dopamine, which plays a prominent role in drug reward. A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), G472A, codes for a Val158Met substitution and results in a fourfold down regulation of enzyme activity. We sequenced exon IV of COMT gene in search for novel polymorphisms and then genotyped four out of five identified by direct sequencing, using TaqMan assay on 266 opioid-dependent and 173 control subjects. Genotype frequencies of the G472A SNP varied significantly (P = 0.029) among the three main ethnic/cultural groups (Caucasians, Hispanics, and African Americans). Using a genotype test, we found a trend to point-wise association (P = 0.053) of the G472A SNP in Hispanic subjects with opiate addiction. Further analysis of G472A genotypes in Hispanic subjects with data stratified by gender identified a point-wise significant (P = 0.049) association of G/A and A/A genotypes with opiate addiction in women, but not men. These point-wise significant results are not significant experiment-wise (at P < 0.05) after correction for multiple testing. No significant association was found with haplotypes of the three most common SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium patterns were similar for the three ethnic/cultural groups.

18266724|t|Histamine-N-methyl transferase polymorphism and risk for migraine.
18266724|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Histamine has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. In the CNS, histamine is almost exclusively metabolized by the polymorphic enzyme histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT). The HNMT gene (chromosome 2q22.1), shows diverse single nucleotide polymorphisms. One of these, located in exon 4 C314T, causes the amino acid substitution Thr105Ile, related to decreased enzyme activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between HNMT polymorphism and the risk for migraine. METHODS: We studied the frequency of the HNMT genotypes and allelic variantes in 197 patients with migraine and 245 healthy controls using a PCR-RLFP method. RESULTS: The frequencies of the HNMT genotypes and allelic variants did not differ significantly between migraine patients and controls, and were unrelated with the age of onset of migraine attacks, gender, personal history of allergic diseases, family history of migraine, or presence of aura. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that HNMT polymorphism in not related with the risk for migraine.

18164595|t|Mutations in the hairless gene underlie APL in three families of Pakistani origin.
18164595|a|BACKGROUND: Atrichia with papular lesions (APL) (OMIM#209500) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited form of irreversible alopecia characterized by papular lesions of keratin-filled cysts on various regions of the body. Males and females are equally affected and present with a distinct pattern of total hair loss on scalp, axilla and body. It begins shortly after birth with the development of hair loss, and patients are normally devoid of eyelashes and eyebrows. Mutations in the hairless (HR) gene have been previously shown to be responsible for APL. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we studied the molecular basis of APL in three unrelated families of Pakistani origin. METHOD: Molecular analysis of the HR genes was performed on genomic DNA from probands and family members. RESULTS: DNA sequencing of the HR gene in family A revealed a novel homozygous 2bp deletion in exon 6 leading to a frameshift and a downstream premature termination codon in exon 8 (1782-83delAG). In family B, we identified a novel homozygous deletion of a G nucleotide at the exon 15-intron 15 boundary, termed 3097delG. Family C carries a previously reported missense mutation consisting of an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 276 resulting in the mutation N970S in exon 14. CONCLUSION: Two mutations identified in this study are novel mutations in the HR gene and extend the body of evidence implicating the hairless gene family in the pathogenesis of human skin disorders. The one previously reported mutation suggests it may represent a recurrent mutation, or alternatively, an allele that is widely dispersed around the world.

18046082|t|Identification of apolipoprotein E Guangzhou (arginine 150 proline), a new variant associated with lipoprotein glomerulopathy.
18046082|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by thrombus-like substances in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and elevated plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE). Previous studies have shown that genetic disorders of apoE may contribute to the pathogenesis of LPG, but LPG may not be caused by apoE gene mutations in Chinese patients. This study investigated the association of a new variant of apoE with LPG in a Chinese family. METHODS: The apoE gene in a family with 4 LPG patients was sequenced. The polymerase chain reaction product of coding region of apoE exon 4 was cloned into pMD 18-T vector and then sequenced. RESULTS: A novel point mutation in exon 4 of the apoE gene was identified in all 4 LPG patients and 1 asymptomatic family member. Sequence analysis confirmed a nucleotide G to C point mutation in exon 4 (base 308) of the apoE gene in all patients and the asymptomatic family member. This missense mutation denotes amino acid substitution of the proline residue for arginine residue at position 150 of apoE. Those patients were all heterozygotes with apoE Guangzhou. One of 2 grandsons was a heterozygous carrier of apoE Guangzhou, although he did not have proteinuria. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that apoE (arginine 150 proline) is a novel apoE variant that etiologically related to LPG. This variant (apoE Guangzhou) may cause a marked molecular conformational change of the apoE and thus impair its binding ability to lipids.

17951029|t|Focal dermal hypoplasia resulting from a new nonsense mutation, p.E300X, in the PORCN gene.
17951029|a|BACKGROUND: Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH) (OMIM 305600) is an X-linked dominant disorder of ecto-mesodermal development. Also known as Goltz syndrome, FDH presents with characteristic linear streaks of hypoplastic dermis and variable abnormalities of bone, nails, hair, limbs, teeth and eyes. The molecular basis of FDH involves mutations in the PORCN gene, which encodes an enzyme that allows membrane targeting and secretion of several Wnt proteins critical for normal tissue development. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular basis of FDH in a 2-year-old Thai girl who presented at birth with depressed, pale linear scars on the trunk and limbs, sparse brittle hair, syndactyly of the right middle and ring fingers, dental caries and radiological features of osteopathia striata. METHODS: Sequencing of genomic DNA from the affected individual and both parents to search for pathogenic mutations in PORCN gene. RESULTS: DNA sequencing disclosed a heterozygous G>T substitution at nucleotide c.898 within exon 10 (NM_203475.1), converting a glutamic acid residue (GAA) to a premature termination codon (TAA). This mutation, designated p.E300X, was not detected in DNA from either parent or in 100 control chromosomes. CONCLUSION: Identification of this new de novo nonsense mutation confirms the diagnosis of FDH in this child and highlights the clinical importance of PORCN and Wnt signalling pathways in embryogenesis.

17868390|t|A novel DFNA5 mutation, IVS8+4 A>G, in the splice donor site of intron 8 causes late-onset non-syndromic hearing loss in a Chinese family.
17868390|a|We report here the clinical, genetic, and molecular characteristics of a large Chinese family exhibiting non-syndromic, late-onset autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss. Clinical evaluation revealed variable phenotypes of hearing loss in terms of severity and age-at-onset of disease in these subjects. Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the disease gene to the DFNA5 locus with a maximum two-point log odds score of 5.39 at [theta] = 0 for marker D7S2457. DNA sequencing of DFNA5 revealed a novel heterozygous IVS8+4 A>G substitution in the splice donor site of intron 8. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed skipping of exon 8 in the mutant transcript. This mutation faithfully cosegregated with hearing loss in the family. In addition, the mutation was absent in 100 unrelated control DNA samples of Chinese origin. The IVS8+4 A>G mutation is predicted to create a shift in the reading frame and introduce a stop codon at position 372, thereby resulting in a prematurely truncated DFNA5 protein. Up to date, a total of four mutations in DFNA5 have been reported to lead to hearing impairment, all of them result in skipping of exon 8 at the mRNA level. Our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that DFNA5-associated hearing loss is caused by a very specific gain-of-function mutation.

17635946|t|A novel point mutation in helix 11 of the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene causing generalized glucocorticoid resistance.
17635946|a|BACKGROUND: Generalized glucocorticoid resistance is a rare condition characterized by partial, end-organ insensitivity to glucocorticoids, compensatory elevations in adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol secretion, and increased production of adrenal steroids with androgenic and/or mineralocorticoid activity. We have identified a new case of glucocorticoid resistance caused by a novel mutation of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene and studied the molecular mechanisms through which the mutant receptor impairs glucocorticoid signal transduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified a novel, single, heterozygous nucleotide (T --> C) substitution at position 2209 (exon 9alpha) of the hGR gene, which resulted in phenylalanine (F) to leucine (L) substitution at amino acid position 737 within helix 11 of the ligand-binding domain of the protein. Compared with the wild-type receptor, the mutant receptor hGRalphaF737L demonstrated a significant ligand-exposure time-dependent decrease in its ability to transactivate the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in response to dexamethasone and displayed a 2-fold reduction in the affinity for ligand, a 12-fold delay in nuclear translocation, and an abnormal interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 coactivator. The mutant receptor preserved its ability to bind to DNA and exerted a dominant-negative effect on the wild-type hGRalpha only after a short duration of exposure to the ligand. CONCLUSIONS: The mutant receptor hGRalphaF737L causes generalized glucocorticoid resistance because of decreased affinity for the ligand, marked delay in nuclear translocation, and/or abnormal interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 coactivator. These findings confirm the importance of the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor in conferring transactivational activity.

17634480|t|Common germline genetic variation in antioxidant defense genes and survival after diagnosis of breast cancer.
17634480|a|PURPOSE: The prognosis of breast cancer varies considerably among individuals, and inherited genetic factors may help explain this variability. Of particular interest are genes involved in defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) because ROS are thought to cause DNA damage and contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined associations between 54 polymorphisms that tag the known common variants (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in 10 genes involved in oxidative damage repair (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GPX4, GSR, TXN, TXN2, TXNRD1, and TXNRD2) and survival in 4,470 women with breast cancer. RESULTS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPX4 (rs713041 and rs757229) were associated with all-cause mortality even after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing (adjusted P = .0041 and P = .0035). These SNPs are correlated with each other (r2 = 0.61). GPX4 rs713041 is located near the selenocysteine insertion sequence element in the GPX4 3' untranslated region, and the rare allele of this SNP is associated with an increased risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 1.27 per rare allele carried (95% CI, 1.13 to 11.43). This effect was not attenuated after adjusting for tumor stage, grade, or estrogen receptor status. We found that the common allele is preferentially expressed in normal lymphocytes, normal breast, and breast tumors compared with the rare allele, but there were no differences in total levels of GPX4 mRNA across genotypes. CONCLUSION: These data provide strong support for the hypothesis that common variation in GPX4 is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer.

17615540|t|A novel "pearl box" cataract associated with a mutation in the connexin 46 (GJA3) gene.
17615540|a|PURPOSE: To undertake mutation screening in the connexin 46 (GJA3) gene in seven congenital cataract families of Indian origin. METHODS: Seven Indian families with congenital cataract were analyzed by detailed family history and clinical evaluation. Each family had two to five affected members. Mutation screening was carried out in the candidate gene, connexin 46 (GJA3), using bidirectional sequencing of amplified products. Segregation of the observed change with the disease phenotype was further tested by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: Sequencing of the coding region of GJA3 showed the presence of a novel, heterozygous C260T change in one family (CC-472) who had two affected members. The cataract phenotype gave the appearance like a "pearl box" in these two affected individuals of this family. The observed C260T substitution created a novel restriction enzyme site for NlaIII and resulted in substitution of highly conserved threonine at position 87 by methionine (T87M). NlaIII restriction digestion analysis revealed this nucleotide change was not in unaffected members of this family or in 100 unrelated control subjects (200 chromosomes) with the same ethnic background. CONCLUSIONS: This is a novel mutation identified in the second transmembrane domain of the connexin 46. These findings thus expand the mutation spectrum of the GJA3 in association with congenital cataract.

17595233|t|Mutations in pattern recognition receptor genes modulate seroreactivity to microbial antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
17595233|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A number of antibodies against microbial epitopes or self-antigens have been associated with Crohn's disease. The development of antibodies reflects a loss of tolerance to intestinal bacteria that underlies Crohn's disease, resulting in an exaggerated adaptive immune response to these bacteria. It was hypothesised that the development of antimicrobial antibodies is influenced by the presence of genetic variants in pattern recognition receptor genes. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of mutations in these innate immune receptor genes (nucleotide oligomerisation domain (NOD) 2/caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 15, NOD1/CARD4, TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR2, TLR1 and TLR6) on the development of antimicrobial and antiglycan antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Materials and METHODS: A cohort of 1163 unrelated patients with IBD (874 Crohn's disease, 259 ulcerative colitis, 30 indeterminate colitis) and 312 controls were analysed for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (gASCA) IgG, anti-laminaribioside antibodies (ALCA) IgG, anti-chitobioside antibodies (ACCA) IgA, anti-mannobioside antibodies (AMCA) IgG and outer membrane porin (Omp) IgA and were genotyped for variants in NOD2/CARD15, TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8, NOD1/CARD4, TLR4, TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6. RESULTS: When compared with Crohn's disease patients without CARD15 mutations, the presence of at least one CARD15 variant in Crohn's disease patients more frequently led to gASCA positivity (66.1% versus 51.5%, p < 0.0001) and ALCA positivity (43.3% versus 34.9%, p = 0.018) and higher gASCA titers (85.7 versus 51.8 ELISA units, p < 0.0001), independent of ileal involvement. A gene dosage effect, with increasing gASCA and ALCA positivity for patients carrying none, one and two CARD15 variants, respectively, was seen for both markers. Similarly, Crohn's disease patients carrying NOD1/CARD4 indel had a higher prevalence of gASCA antibodies than wild-type patients (63.8% versus 55.2%, p = 0.014), also with a gene dosage effect. An opposite effect was observed for the TLR4 D299G and TLR2 P631H variants, with a lower prevalence of ACCA antibodies (23.4% versus 35%, p = 0.013) and Omp antibodies (20.5% versus 34.6%, p = 0.009), respectively. CONCLUSION: Variants in innate immune receptor genes were found to influence antibody formation against microbial epitopes. In this respect, it is intriguing that an opposite effect of CARD15 and TLR4 variants was observed. These findings may contribute to an understanding of the aetiology of the seroreactivity observed in IBD.

17495183|t|Tenomodulin is associated with obesity and diabetes risk: the Finnish diabetes prevention study.
17495183|a|We recently showed that long-term weight reduction changes the gene expression profile of adipose tissue in overweight individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). One of the responding genes was X-chromosomal tenomodulin (TNMD), a putative angiogenesis inhibitor. Our aim was to study the associations of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes with adiposity, glucose metabolism, and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms from two different haploblocks were genotyped from 507 participants of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS). Sex-specific genotype effects were observed. Three markers of haploblock 1 were associated with features of adiposity in women (rs5966709, rs4828037) and men (rs11798018). Markers rs2073163 and rs1155794 from haploblock 2 were associated with 2-hour plasma glucose levels in men during the 3-year follow-up. The same two markers together with rs2073162 associated with the conversion of IGT to T2D in men. The risk of developing T2D was approximately 2-fold in individuals with genotypes associated with higher 2-hour plasma glucose levels; the hazard ratios were 2.192 (p = 0.025) for rs2073162-A, 2.191 (p = 0.027) for rs2073163-C, and 1.998 (p = 0.054) for rs1155974-T. These results suggest that TNMD polymorphisms are associated with adiposity and also with glucose metabolism and conversion from IGT to T2D in men.

17372760|t|Atypical Rothmund-Thomson syndrome in a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in RECQL4 gene and phenotypic features in RECQL4 syndromes.
17372760|a|We describe the natural history of the RTSII phenotype in a 7-year-old boy who developed intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, failure to thrive and persisting diarrhoea. The growth hormone stimulation test identified an isolated growth hormone deficiency. Since infancy, the patient manifested skin lesions characterized by a very mild poikilodermic-like appearance on the cheeks only, widespread caf  -au-lait spots and the absence of eyebrows and eyelashes. There was no cataract. Orthopaedic and radiologic work-up identified the absence of thumb anomaly and radial head luxation and patellar hypoplasia. Neurologic, cognitive milestones and intelligence were normal. The cytogenetic work-up did not show any anomaly. Based on this clinical presentation, we carried out a sequencing analysis of the RECQL4 gene, which is responsible for Rothmund-Thomson, RAPADILINO and Baller-Gerold syndromes and found a splice site mutation (IVS10-1G>A) and a nucleotide substitution in exon 12 (L638P). The mother was identified as a carrier for the substitution in exon 12 and the father for the splice site mutation, respectively. An analysis of the transcripts focused on the RECQL4 helicase domain: in the proband only those generated from the maternal L638 allele were present. This case report emphasizes the clinical overlap between RAPADILINO and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes within a continuum phenotypic spectrum. The distinctive set of clinical signs displayed by the patient may be accounted for by his unique combination of two different RECQL4 mutations. The molecular findings provide information that enhances our comprehension of genotype-phenotype correlations in RECQL4 diseases, enables a more precise genetic counseling to the parents and facilitates a more appropriate long-term follow-up to the affected child.

17221831|t|The G51S purine nucleoside phosphorylase polymorphism is associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients.
17221831|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a polygenic and multifactorial complex disease, whose etiopathology is still unclear, however several genetic factors have shown to increase the risk of developing the disease. Purine nucleotides and nucleosides play an important role in the brain. Besides their role in neurotransmission and neuromodulation, they are involved in trophic factor release, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. These mediators may also have a pivotal role in the control of neurodegenerative processes associated with AD. In this report the distribution of the exonic G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, resulting in the amino acid substitution serine to glycine at position 51 (G51S), was investigated in a large population of AD patients (n=321) and non-demented control (n=208). The PNP polymorphism distribution was not different between patients and controls. The polymorphism distribution was also analyzed in AD patients stratified according to differential progressive rate of cognitive decline during a 2-year follow-up. An increased representation of the PNP AA genotype was observed in AD patients with fast cognitive deterioration in comparison with that from patients with slow deterioration rate. Our findings suggest that the G51S PNP polymorphism is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline in AD patients, highlighting the important role of purine metabolism in the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder.

17177139|t|A novel mutation (E333D) in the thyroid hormone beta receptor causing resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome.
17177139|a|Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormones (TH), failure to suppress pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion, and variable peripheral tissue responsiveness to TH. The disorder is associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone beta receptor (TRbeta). Here, we report a novel natural RTH mutation (E333D) located in the large carboxy-terminal ligand binding domain of TRbeta. The mutation was identified in a 22-year-old French woman coming to medical attention because of an increasing overweight. Biochemical tests showed elevated free thyroxine (T4: 20.8 pg/ml (normal, 8.5-18)) and triiodothyronine (T3: 5.7 pg/ml (normal, 1.4-4)) in the serum, together with an inappropriately nonsuppressed TSH level of 4.7 mU/ml (normal, 0.4-4). Her father and her brother's serum tests also showed biochemical abnormalities consistent with RTH. Direct sequencing of the TRbeta gene revealed a heterozygous transition 1284A>C in exon 9 resulting in substitution of glutamic acid 333 by aspartic acid residue (E333D). Further functional analyses of the novel TRbeta mutant were conducted. We found that the E333D mutation neither significantly affected the affinity of the receptor for T3 nor modified heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptor (RXR) when bound to DNA. However, in transient transfection assays, the E333D TRbeta mutant exhibited impaired transcriptional regulation on two distinct positively regulated thyroid response elements (F2- and DR4-TREs) as well as on the negatively regulated human TSHalpha promoter. Moreover, a dominant inhibition of the wild-type TRbeta counterpart transactivation function was observed on both a positive (F2-TRE) and a negative (TSHalpha) promoter. These results strongly suggest that the E333D TRbeta mutation is responsible for the RTH phenotype in the proposita's family.

17065190|t|Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms do not confer susceptibility for the development of adult onset polymyositis/dermatomyositis in UK Caucasians.
17065190|a|OBJECTIVES: Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) form part of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). The chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is expressed at sites of the T cell inflammatory response in the IIMs. We thus investigate whether genetic markers in the MCP-1 gene confer disease susceptibility for the development of PM and DM. METHODS: DNA samples were analysed from a group of 195 UK Caucasian IIM patients, comprising 103 PM and 92 DM. Their results were compared with those of 162 ethnically matched controls. The polymorphic positions of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one insertion-deletion sequence within regions coding for MCP-1 were tested. The SNPs examined were located in intron 1 (rs2857657, C/G), exon 2 (rs4586, A/G) and the 3 ' untranslated region (rs13900, C/T). The insertion-deletion sequence was located in intron 1 (rs3917887, AGCTCCTCCTTCTC/-). Each SNP was tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and allelic/genotypic associations. Haplotype frequencies were estimated using the Expectation/Maximization algorithm. RESULTS: There was strong linkage disequilibrium present between three out of these four markers. The majority of controls were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. No allelic, genotypic or haplotypic associations were detected when comparing PM or DM cases to controls, or when PM and DM were compared with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic markers in the MCP-1 gene do not demonstrate significant genetic associations with the IIMs, and do not discriminate PM from DM in a UK Caucasian population.

17003923|t|Gene polymorphisms implicated in influencing susceptibility to venous and arterial thromboembolism: frequency distribution in a healthy German population.
17003923|a|Evolvement and progression of cardiovascular diseases affecting the venous and arterial system are influenced by a multitude of environmental and hereditary factors. Many of these hereditary factors consist of defined gene polymorphisms, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or insertion-deletion polymorphisms, which directly or indirectly affect the hemostatic system. The frequencies of individual hemostatic gene polymorphisms in different normal populations are well defined. However, descriptions of patterns of genetic variability of a larger extent of different factors of hereditary hypercoagulability in single populations are scarce. The aim of this study was i) to give a detailed description of the frequencies of factors of hereditary thrombophilia and their combinations in a German population (n = 282) and ii) to compare their distributions with those reported for other regions. Variants of coagulation factors [factor V 1691G>A (factor V Leiden), factor V 4070A>G (factor V HR2 haplotype), factor VII Arg353Gln, factor XIII Val34Leu, beta-fibrinogen -455G>A, prothrombin 20210G>A], coagulation inhibitors [tissue factor pathway inhibitor 536C>T, thrombomodulin 127G>A], fibrinolytic factors [angiotensin converting enzyme intron 16 insertion/deletion, factor VII-activating protease 1601G>A (FSAP Marburg I), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-675 insertion/deletion (5G/4G), tissue plasminogen activator intron h deletion/insertion], and other factors implicated in influencing susceptibility to thromboembolic diseases [apolipoprotein E2/E3/E4, glycoprotein Ia 807C>T, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C>T] were included. The distribution of glycoprotein Ia 807C>T deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and a comparison with previously published data indicates marked region and ethnicity dependent differences in the genotype distributions of some other factors.

17002658|t|Severe prothrombin deficiency caused by prothrombin-Edmonton (R-4Q) combined with a previously undetected deletion.
17002658|a|BACKGROUND: During infancy, a male patient experienced several life-threatening bleeding episodes. Standard coagulation tests revealed that the patient's plasma prothrombin activity was 8%, while his father's and mother's levels were 74% and 62%, respectively. OBJECTIVES: A molecular genetic approach was used to determine the molecular basis of prothrombin deficiency within the family. PATIENT/METHODS: Prothrombin genomic DNA fragments were amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, liver cDNA fragments were amplified from the patient by using reverse transcription (RT) and PCR. The nucleotide sequences of the DNA fragments were determined. RESULTS: A novel, heterozygous point mutation (g.1755 G > A, named prothrombin-Edmonton) was detected in the patient and his mother, resulting in the mutation of Arg-4 in the prothrombin propeptide to Gln (R-4Q). RT-PCR analysis of the patient's liver sample demonstrated the presence of two mRNA transcripts that differed by the presence or absence of exon 11. Real-time PCR analysis on genomic DNA and cDNA confirmed a deletion (g.10435_10809del) in the paternal allele. CONCLUSIONS: The patient has a maternally-inherited point mutation (R-4Q) and a paternally-inherited deletion. By analogy with the previously reported factor IX San Dimas, the R-4Q mutation probably causes under-carboxylation of prothrombin and poor cleavage of the propeptide in the hepatocyte. The deletion probably results in a polypeptide that lacks 50 amino acids from the protease domain; this is likely to impair folding, secretion, stability and/or activity of the truncated prothrombin. The two mutations combine to give the prothrombin deficiency observed in the patient.

16989765|t|A novel His158Arg mutation in TIMP3 causes a late-onset form of Sorsby fundus dystrophy.
16989765|a|PURPOSE: To describe the phenotype and genotype of a family with suspected Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD). DESIGN: Case reports and results of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis. METHODS: Clinical features were determined by complete ophthalmologic examination or by review of medical records. Mutational analysis of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)3 gene was performed by DNA resequencing. Biochemical properties of the mutant TIMP3 protein were studied, and phylogenetic and molecular modeling analyses of TIMP proteins were performed. RESULTS: Fundi of four affected family members demonstrated active or regressed bilateral choroidal neovascularization, whereas another affected individual displayed severe diffuse pigmentary degeneration associated with nyctalopia characteristic of SFD. Onset of disease occurred in the fifth to seventh decades of life. A heterozygous His158Arg mutation was found in seven affected family members and was absent from an unaffected member and 98 unrelated controls. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that histidine 158 is an evolutionarily conserved residue in most vertebrate TIMP homologs and predict that substitution by arginine disrupts TIMP3 function. The mutant protein appears to be expressed by fibroblasts from an affected family member. Molecular modeling suggests that TIMP3 residue 158 may be part of a protein-protein interaction interface. CONCLUSION: A novel mutation in TIMP3 causes a late-onset form of SFD in this family. His158Arg is the first reported TIMP3 SFD coding sequence mutation that does not create an unpaired cysteine. Further study of this unusual mutation may provide insight into the mechanism of SFD pathogenesis.

16953235|t|Analysis of a missense variant of the human N-formyl peptide receptor that is associated with agonist-independent beta-arrestin association and indices of inflammation.
16953235|a|Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) is a potent chemoattractant molecule released from both bacteria and damaged mitochondria that activates fMLP receptors (FPR) leading to neutrophil chemotaxis, degranulation and superoxide production. A common missense single nucleotide polymorphism in the human FPR1 gene at nucleotide c.32C>T results in the amino-acid substitution, p.I11T, in the FPR1 extracellular amino-terminus. The minor (c.32T) allele frequencies were 0.25, 0.27, 0.25, 0.15 and 0.14 in healthy Caucasian, African, East Indian, Chinese and Native Canadian individuals, respectively. In subjects homozygous for the p.T11 allele, we find elevated serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, increased absolute counts of blood leukocytes and neutrophils, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. When expressed in HEK 293 and RBL-2H3 cells a substantial proportion of FPR1 p.I11T variant is retained intracellularly and agonist-independent internalization of the FPR1 p.I11T variant, but not the wild-type FPR1, is constitutively associated with beta-arrestin2-GFP in vesicles. Moreover, basal N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase release is increased in primary neutrophils isolated from subjects either heterozygous or homozygous for the FPR1 p.T11 allele. Taken together, the data suggest an increased receptor activity and phenotypic expression of increased inflammatory indices in subjects with the p.T11 allele.

16911351|t|Clinical characterization and evaluation of DYT1 gene in Indian primary dystonia patients.
16911351|a|OBJECTIVES: Dystonia is a common movement disorder. The purpose of this study is to examine the relative distribution of the primary dystonia subtypes and identify mutation (s) in the DYT1 gene in Indian patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary dystonia patients (n = 178) and controls (n = 63), lacking any symptoms of the disease, were recruited for the study from eastern India. The nucleotide variants in the DYT1 gene were identified by carrying out polymerase chain reaction, single stranded conformation polymorphism, and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Unlike other reports, pain and/or tremor was more common in our sporadic patients than in familial cases. Three reported and two novel changes were identified in this gene. The homozygous genotype (G,G) for a missense variant (c.646G > C; Asp216His) was significantly over-represented in the patients compared with controls (P < 0.05). However, the commonly reported 3 bp deletion (904-906delGAG) was not detected. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the DYT1 gene might have a limited role in causation of dystonia in the Indian population.

16840830|t|Two novel mutations in the MEN1 gene in subjects with multiple endocrine neoplasia-1.
16840830|a|Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic endocrine and pituitary adenomas as well as germline mutation of the MEN1 gene. We describe 2 families with MEN1 with novel mutations in the MEN1 gene. One family was of Turkish origin, and the index patient had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) plus a prolactinoma; three relatives had PHPT only. The index patient in the second family was a 46-yr-old woman of Chinese origin living in Taiwan. This patient presented with a complaint of epigastric pain and watery diarrhea over the past 3 months, and had undergone subtotal parathyroidectomy and enucleation of pancreatic islet cell tumor about 10 yr before. There was also a prolactinoma. Sequence analysis of the MEN1 gene from leukocyte genomic DNA revealed heterozygous mutations in both probands. The Turkish patient and her affected relatives all had a heterozygous A to G transition at codon 557 (AAG-->GAG) of exon 10 of MEN1 that results in a replacement of lysine by glutamic acid. The Chinese index patient and one of her siblings had a heterozygous mutation at codon 418 of exon 9 (GAC-->TAT) that results in a substitution of aspartic acid by tyrosine. In conclusion, we have identified 2 novel missense mutations in the MEN1 gene.

16838170|t|Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the HNF4alpha gene are associated with the conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus: the STOP-NIDDM trial.
16838170|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) is a transcription factor, which is necessary for normal function of human liver and pancreatic islets. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HNF4A, encoding HNF4alpha, influenced the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects of the STOP-NIDDM trial. This trial aimed at evaluating the effect of acarbose compared to placebo in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eight SNPs covering the intragenic and alternate P2 promoter regions of HNF4A were genotyped in study samples using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assays. Three SNPs in the P2 promoter region (rs4810424, rs1884614, and rs2144908) were in almost complete association (D'>0.97, r (2)>0.95) and, therefore, only rs4810424 was included in further analyses. Female carriers of the less frequent C allele of rs4810424 had a 1.7-fold elevated risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.66; P=0.020] for the conversion to diabetes compared to women with the common genotype after the adjustment for age, treatment group (placebo or acarbose), smoking, weight at baseline, and weight change. No association was found in men. Haplotype analysis based on three SNPs (rs4810424, rs2071197, and rs3818247) representing the linkage disequilibrium blocks in our study population indicated that the conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus was dependent on the number of risk alleles in different haplotypes in women. Our results suggest that SNPs of HNF4A and their haplotypes predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus in female subjects of the STOP-NIDDM study population.

16781314|t|Ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome resulting from a new homozygous mutation, 888delC, in the desmosomal protein plakophilin 1.
16781314|a|We report an unusual case of an inherited disorder of the desmosomal protein plakophilin 1, resulting in ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome. The affected 6-year-old boy had red skin at birth and subsequently developed skin fragility, progressive plantar keratoderma, nail dystrophy, and alopecia. Skin biopsy revealed widening of intercellular spaces in the epidermis and a reduced number of small, poorly formed desmosomes. Mutation analysis of the plakophilin 1 gene PKP1 revealed a homozygous deletion of C at nucleotide 888 within exon 5. This mutation differs from the PKP1 gene pathology reported in 8 previously published individuals with this rare genodermatosis. However, all cases show similar clinical features, highlighting the importance of functional plakophilin 1 in maintaining desmosomal adhesion in skin, as well as the role of this protein in aspects of ectodermal development.

16723031|t|Polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase gene and susceptibility to breast cancer in a Chinese population: a case-control analysis.
16723031|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulative evidence suggests that low folate intake is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Polymorphisms in genes involved in folate metabolism may influence DNA methylation, nucleotide synthesis, and thus individual susceptibility to cancer. Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) is a key enzyme that participates in folate metabolism and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP to dTMP in the process of DNA synthesis. Two potentially functional polymorphisms [a 28-bp tandem repeat in the TYMS 5'-untranslated enhanced region (TSER) and a 6-bp deletion/insertion in the TYMS 3'-untranslated region (TS 3'-UTR)] were suggested to be correlated with alteration of thymidylate synthase expression and associated with cancer risk. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that polymorphisms of the TYMS gene are associated with risk of breast cancer, we genotyped these two polymorphisms in a case-control study of 432 incident cases with invasive breast cancer and 473 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. RESULTS: We found that the distribution of TS3'-UTR (1494del6) genotype frequencies were significantly different between the cases and controls (P = 0.026). Compared with the TS3'-UTR del6/del6 wild-type genotype, a significantly reduced risk was associated with the ins6/ins6 homozygous variant genotype (adjusted OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.35-0.97) but not the del6/ins6 genotype (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.82-1.46). Furthermore, breast cancer risks associated with the TS3'-UTR del6/del6 genotype were more evident in older women, postmenopausal subjects, individuals with a younger age at first-live birth and individuals with an older age at menarche. However, there was no evidence for an association between the TSER polymorphism and breast cancer risks. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the TS3'-UTR del6 polymorphism may play a role in the etiology of breast cancer. Further larger population-based studies as well as functional evaluation of the variants are warranted to confirm our findings.

16575011|t|Tumor thymidylate synthase 1494del6 genotype as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients receiving fluorouracil-based adjuvant treatment.
16575011|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the value of germline and tumor thymidylate synthase (TS) genotyping as a prognostic marker in a series of colorectal cancer patients receiving adjuvant fluorouracil (FU) -based treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine colorectal cancer patients homogeneously treated with FU plus levamisole or leucovorin in the adjuvant setting were included. TS enhancer region, 3R G > C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and TS 1494del6 polymorphisms were assessed in both fresh-frozen normal mucosa and tumor. Mutational analyses of TS and allelic imbalances were studied in all primary tumors and in 18 additional metachronic metastases. TS protein immunostaining was assessed in an expanded series of 214 tumors. Multivariate Cox models were adjusted for stage, differentiation, and location. RESULTS: Tumor genotyping (frequency of allelic loss, 26%) showed that the 3R/3R genotype was associated with a better outcome (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.93; P = .020 for the recessive model). 3R G > C SNP genotyping did not add prognostic information. Tumor TS 1494del6 allele (frequency of allelic loss, 36%) was protective (for each allele with the deletion, based on an additive model, HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.82; P = .0034). Both polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.71, P < .001), and the 3R/-6 base pair (bp) haplotype showed a significant overall survival benefit compared with the most prevalent haplotype 2R/+6bp (HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.85; P = .017). No TS point mutation was detected in primary tumors or metastases. TS protein immunostaining was not associated with survival or any of the genotypes analyzed. CONCLUSION: Tumor TS 1494del6 genotype may be a prognostic factor in FU-based adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer patients.

16506214|t|Genetic variation in the COX-2 gene and the association with prostate cancer risk.
16506214|a|COX-2 is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. The prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are involved in inflammation and pain response in different tissues in the body. Accumulating evidence from epidemiologic studies, chemical carcinogen-induced rodent models and clinical trials indicate that COX-2 plays a role in human carcinogenesis and is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue. We examined whether sequence variants in the COX-2 gene are associated with prostate cancer risk. We analyzed a large population-based case-control study, cancer prostate in Sweden (CAPS) consisting of 1,378 cases and 782 controls. We evaluated 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire COX-2 gene in 94 subjects of the control group. Five SNPs had a minor allele frequency of more than 5% in our study population and these were genotyped in all case patients and control subjects and gene-specific haplotypes were constructed. A statistically significant difference in allele frequency between cases and controls was observed for 2 of the SNPs (+3100 T/G and +8365 C/T), with an odds ratio of 0.78 (95% CI=0.64-0.96) and 0.65 (95% CI=0.45-0.94) respectively. In the haplotype analysis, 1 haplotype carrying the variant allele from both +3100 T/G and +8365 C/T, with a population frequency of 3%, was also significantly associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer (p=0.036, global simulated p-value=0.046). This study supports the hypothesis that inflammation is involved in prostate carcinogenesis and that sequence variation within the COX-2 gene influence the risk of prostate cancer.

16419642|t|A novel missense mutation, F826Y, in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene in Japanese hypertensives: its implications for clinical phenotypes.
16419642|a|A gain-of-function mutation resulting in the S810L amino acid substitution in the hormone-binding domain of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR, locus symbol NR3C2) is responsible for early-onset hypertension that is exacerbated in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to test whether other types of missense mutations in the hormone-binding domain could be implicated in hypertension in Japanese. Here, we screened 942 Japanese patients with hypertension for the S810L mutation in exon 6 in the MR. We did not identify the S810L mutation in our hypertensive population, indicating that S810L does not play a major role in the etiology of essential hypertension in Japanese. However, we identified a novel missense mutation, F826Y, in three patients in a heterozygous state, in addition to four single nucleotide polymorphisms, including one synonymous mutation (L809L). The F826Y mutation is present in the MR hormone-binding domain and might affect the ligand affinity. The F826Y mutation was also identified in 13 individuals (5 hypertensives and 8 normotensives) in a Japanese general population (n=3,655). The allele frequency was 0.00178. The frequencies of the F826Y mutation in the hypertensive population (3/942) and in the hypertensive group (5/ 1,480) and the normotensive group (8/2,175) in the general population were not significantly different, suggesting that this mutation does not greatly affect hypertension. Although it is unclear at present whether or not the F826Y mutation makes a substantial contribution to the mineralocorticoid receptor activity, this missense mutation may contribute, to some extent, to clinical phenotypes through its effects on MR.

16410744|t|Genetic alterations in primary glioblastomas in Japan.
16410744|a|Current knowledge of genetic alterations in glioblastomas is based largely on genetic analyses of tumors from mainly caucasian patients in the United States and Europe. In the present study, screening for several key genetic alterations was performed on 77 primary (de novo) glioblastomas in Japanese patients. SSCP followed by DNA sequencing revealed TP53 mutations in 16 of 73 (22%) glioblastomas and PTEN mutations in 13 of 63 (21%) cases analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed EGFR amplification in 25 of 77 (32%) cases and p16 homozygous deletion in 32 of 77 (42%) cases. Quantitative microsatellite analysis revealed LOH 10q in 41 of 59 (69%) glioblastomas. The frequencies of these genetic alterations were similar to those reported for primary glioblastomas at the population level in Switzerland. As previously observed for glioblastomas in Europe, there was a positive association between EGFR amplification and p16 deletion (p=0.009), whereas there was an inverse association between TP53 mutations and p16 deletion (p=0.049) in glioblastomas in Japan. Multivariate analyses showed that radiotherapy was significantly predictive for longer survival of glioblastoma patients (p=0.002). SSCP followed by DNA sequencing of the kinase domain (exons 18-21) of the EGFR gene revealed mutations in 2 ou of 69 (3%) glioblastomas in Japan and in 4 of 81 (5%) glioblastomas in Switzerland. The allele frequencies of polymorphisms at codon 787 CAG/CAA (Gln/Gln) in glioblastomas in Japan were G/G (82.4%), G/A (10.8%), A/A (6.8%), corresponding to G 0.878 versus A 0.122, significantly different from those in glioblastomas in Switzerland: G/G (27.2%), G/A (28.4%), A/A (44.4%), corresponding to G 0.414 versus A 0.586 (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that primary glioblastomas in Japan show genetic alterations similar to those in Switzerland, suggesting a similar molecular basis in caucasians and Asians, despite different genetic backgrounds, including different status of a polymorphism in the EGFR gene.

16288197|t|Genetic homogeneity for inherited congenital microcoria loci in an Asian Indian pedigree.
16288197|a|PURPOSE: Congenital microcoria is a rare autosomal dominant developmental disorder of the iris associated with myopia and juvenile open angle glaucoma. Linkage to the chromosomal locus 13q31-q32 has previously been reported in a large French family. In the current study, a three generation Asian Indian family with 15 congenital microcoria (pupils with a diameter <2 mm) affected members was studied for linkage to candidate microsatellite markers at the 13q31-q32 locus. METHODS: Twenty-four members of the family were clinically examined and genomic DNA was extracted. Microsatellite markers at 13q31-q32 were PCR amplified and run on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer and genotyped with the GeneScan analysis. Two point and multipoint linkage analyses were performed using the MLINK and SUPERLINK programs. RESULTS: Peak two point LOD scores of 3.5, 4.7, and 5.3 were found co-incident with consecutive markers D13S154, DCT, and D13S1280. Multipoint analysis revealed a 4 cM region encompassing D13S1300 to D13S1280 where the LOD remains just over 6.0 Thus we confirm localization of the congenital microcoria locus to chromosomal locus 13q31-q32. In addition, eight individuals who had both microcoria and glaucoma were screened for glaucoma genes: myocilin (MYOC), optineurin (OPTN) and CYP1B1. Using direct sequencing a point mutation (144 G>A) resulting in a Q48H substitution in exon 1 of the MYOC gene was observed in five of the eight glaucoma patients, but not in unaffected family members and 100 unrelated controls. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed the localization of the congenital microcoria locus (MCOR) to 13q31-q32 in a large Asian Indian family and conclude that current information suggests this is a single locus disorder and genetically homogeneous. When combined with the initial linkage paper our haplotype and linkage data map the MCOR locus to a 6-7 cM region between D13S265 and D13S1280. The DCT locus, a member of the tyrosinase family involved in pigmentation, maps within this region. Data presented here supports the hypothesis that congenital microcoria is a potential risk factor for glaucoma, although this observation is complicated by the partial segregation of MYOC Q48H (1q24.3-q25.2), a mutation known to be associated with glaucoma in India. Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis continues with the hope that characterizing the micocoria gene will lead to a better understanding of microcoria and glaucoma causation. The relationship between microcoria, glaucoma, and the MYOC Q48H mutation in this family is discussed.

16277682|t|Segregation of a M404V mutation of the p62/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene with polyostotic Paget's disease of bone in an Italian family.
16277682|a|Mutations of the p62/Sequestosome 1 gene (p62/SQSTM1) account for both sporadic and familial forms of Paget's disease of bone (PDB). We originally described a methionine-->valine substitution at codon 404 (M404V) of exon 8, in the ubiquitin protein-binding domain of p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian PDB patient. The collection of data from the patient's pedigree provided evidence for a familial form of PDB. Extension of the genetic analysis to other relatives in this family demonstrated segregation of the M404V mutation with the polyostotic PDB phenotype and provided the identification of six asymptomatic gene carriers. DNA for mutational analysis of the exon 8 coding sequence was obtained from 22 subjects, 4 PDB patients and 18 clinically unaffected members. Of the five clinically ascertained affected members of the family, four possessed the M404V mutation and exhibited the polyostotic form of PDB, except one patient with a single X-ray-assessed skeletal localization and one with a polyostotic disease who had died several years before the DNA analysis. By both reconstitution and mutational analysis of the pedigree, six unaffected subjects were shown to bear the M404V mutation, representing potential asymptomatic gene carriers whose circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase were recently assessed as still within the normal range. Taken together, these results support a genotype-phenotype correlation between the M404V mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene and a polyostotic form of PDB in this family. The high penetrance of the PDB trait in this family together with the study of the asymptomatic gene carriers will allow us to confirm the proposed genotype-phenotype correlation and to evaluate the potential use of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the early detection of relatives at risk for PDB.

16216473|t|HPRTSardinia: a new point mutation causing HPRT deficiency without Lesch-Nyhan disease.
16216473|a|Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency always causing hyperuricemia presents various degrees of neurological manifestations, the most severe which is Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The HPRT gene is situated in the region Xq26-q27.2 and consists of 9 exons. At least 300 different mutations at different sites in the HPRT coding region from exon 1 to exon 9 have been identified. A new mutation in the HPRT gene has been determined in one patient with complete deficiency of erythrocyte activity, with hyperuricemia and gout but without Lesch-Nyhan disease. Analysis of cultured fibroblasts revealed minimal residual HPRT activity mainly when guanine was the substrate. Genomic DNA sequencing demonstrated patient's mother heterozygosity for the mutation and no mutation in her brother. The mutation consists in a C-->T transversion at cDNA base 463 (C463T) in exon 6, resulting in proline to serine substitution at codon 155 (P155S). This mutation had not been reported previously and has been designated HPRT(Sardinia). The mutation identified in this patient allows some expression of functional enzyme in nucleated cells such as fibroblasts, indicating that such cell type may add further information to conventional blood analysis. A multicentre survey gathering patients with variant neurological forms could contribute to understand the pathophysiology of the neurobehavioral symptoms of HPRT deficiency.

16167150|t|Genetic variation in UCP2 (uncoupling protein-2) is associated with energy metabolism in Pima Indians.
16167150|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is thought to play a role in insulin secretion and the development of obesity. In this study, we investigated the effects of genetic variation in UCP2 on type 2 diabetes and obesity, as well as on metabolic phenotypes related to these diseases, in Pima Indians. METHODS: The coding and untranslated regions of UCP2, and approximately 1 kb of the 5' upstream region, were sequenced in DNA samples taken from 83 extremely obese Pima Indians who were not first-degree relatives. RESULTS: Five variants were identified: (1) a -866G/A in the 5' upstream region; (2) a G/A in exon 2; (3) a C/T resulting in an Ala55Val substitution in exon 4; and (4, 5) two insertion/deletions (ins/del; 45-bp and 3-bp) in the 3' untranslated region. Among the 83 subjects whose DNA was sequenced, the -866G/A was in complete genotypic concordance with the Ala55Val and the 3-bp ins/del polymorphism. The G/A polymorphism in exon 2 was extremely rare. To capture the common variation in this gene for association analyses, the -866G/A variant (as a representative of Ala55Val and the 3-bp ins/del polymorphism) and the 45-bp ins/del were also genotyped for 864 full-blooded Pima Indians. Neither of these variants was associated with type 2 diabetes or body mass index. However, in a subgroup of 185 subjects who had undergone detailed metabolic measurements, these variants were associated with 24-h energy expenditure as measured in a human metabolic chamber (p=0.007 for the 45-bp ins/del and p=0.03 for the -866G/A after adjusting for age, sex, family membership, fat-free mass and fat mass). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that variation in UCP2 may play a role in energy metabolism, but this gene does not contribute significantly to the aetiology of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity in Pima Indians.

16152606|t|Carrier frequency of mutation 657del5 in the NBS1 gene in a population of Polish pediatric patients with sporadic lymphoid malignancies.
16152606|a|Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a human autosomal recessive disease characterized by genomic instability and enhanced cancer predisposition, in particular to lymphoma and leukemia. Recently, significantly higher frequencies of heterozygous carriers of the Slavic founder NBS1 mutation, 657del5, were found in Russian children with sporadic lymphoid malignancies, and in Polish adults with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, the substitution 643C>T (R215W) has also been found in excess among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In an attempt to asses the contribution of both mutations to the development of sporadic lymphoid malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples from a large group of Polish pediatric patients. The NBS1 mutation 657del5 on one allele was found in 3 of 270 patients with ALL and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carrier was found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). No carriers of the variant R215W were detected in any studied group. The relative frequency of the 657del5 mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by place of patient residence, of whom 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006). In the analyzed population with malignancies, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of mutation 657del5 was found in comparison with the control Polish population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65). This finding indicates that the frequency of the mutation carriers was indeed increased in patients with ALL and NHL (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, NBS1 gene heterozygosity is not a major risk factor for lymphoid malignancies in childhood and adolescence.

16120104|t|A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'-untranslated region of the hPER2 gene is associated with diurnal preference.
16120104|a|The PERIOD2 (PER2) gene is a key component of the molecular mechanism that generates circadian rhythms in mammals. A missense mutation in the human PER2 gene has previously been linked to advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS). We have investigated three other single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the hPER2 gene, one downstream of the transcription start site (C-1228T), one in exon 2 in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) (C111G), and one missense mutation (G3853A) causing a glycine to glutamine substitution in the predicted protein. Subjects selected from a group of 484 volunteers for extreme morning or evening preference, or intermediate diurnal preference were genotyped with regard to the three polymorphisms (n=35 for each group). Whereas allele frequencies for the other two polymorphisms did not differ significantly between any of the groups, the 111G allele frequency was significantly higher in subjects with extreme morning preference (0.14) than in subjects with extreme evening preference (0.03) (Fisher's exact test, two-sided P value=0.031, odds ratio=5.67). No significant difference in 111G allele frequency was observed between either of these groups and subjects with intermediate diurnal preference. Computer prediction indicated that the C111G polymorphism, which occurs 12 bases upstream from the translation start codon, might alter the secondary structure of the transcript. The PER2 111G allele associates with morning preference and is a potential candidate allele for ASPS.

16046395|t|Allelic expression imbalance of human mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) caused by variant A118G.
16046395|a|As a primary target for opioid drugs and peptides, the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) plays a key role in pain perception and addiction. Genetic variants of OPRM1 have been implicated in predisposition to drug addiction, in particular the single nucleotide polymorphism A118G, leading to an N40D substitution, with an allele frequency of 10-32%, and uncertain functions. We have measured allele-specific mRNA expression of OPRM1 in human autopsy brain tissues, using A118G as a marker. In 8 heterozygous samples measured, the A118 mRNA allele was 1.5-2.5-fold more abundant than the G118 allele. Transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells of a cDNA representing only the coding region of OPRM1, carrying adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine in position 118, resulted in 1.5-fold lower mRNA levels only for OPRM1-G118, and more than 10-fold lower OPRM1 protein levels, measured by Western blotting and receptor binding assay. After transfection and inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D, analysis of mRNA turnover failed to reveal differences in mRNA stability between A118 and G118 alleles, indicating a defect in transcription or mRNA maturation. These results indicate that OPRM1-G118 is a functional variant with deleterious effects on both mRNA and protein yield. Clarifying the functional relevance of polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to a complex disorder such as drug addiction provides a foundation for clinical association studies.

16005363|t|Identification of a novel WFS1 mutation (AFF344-345ins) in Japanese patients with Wolfram syndrome.
16005363|a|Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early onset diabetes mellitus, progressive optic atrophy, sensorineural deafness and diabetes insipidus. Affected individuals may also have renal tract abnormalities as well as neurogical and psychiatric syndromes. WFS1 encoding a transmembrane protein was identified as the gene responsible for WFS. We report herein a Japanese family, of which two members had this syndrome. In the WFS1 gene of these patients, we identified a novel mutation, a nine nucleotide insertion (AFF344-345ins). In addition, one of these patients had preclinical hypopituitarism, which is an unusual feature of WFS. As only the two family members homozygous for the mutation showed WFS, these data support the notion that this mutation is the cause of WFS.

15768551|t|Hb zoeterwoude [beta23(B5)Val-->Ala)]: a new beta-globin variant found in association with erythrocytosis.
15768551|a|We describe the characterization of a new hemoglobin (Hb) variant found in a 77-year-old Dutch woman, suspected of hypoxia-mediated erythrocytosis. The typical blood parameters (Hb 17.3 g/dL; PCV 0.525 L/L; RBC 5.82 x 10(12)/L) could not be explained by any of the pathological or physiological conditions causing erythrocytosis. The patient was preventively phlebotomized because of intermittent claudication and erythrocytosis. At the hematological and biochemical levels, no anemia or hemolysis were present and no abnormal Hb fractions were detectable on alkaline electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Molecular analysis revealed intact alpha-globin genes and a heterozygosity for a GTT-->GCT transition at codon 23 of the beta-globin gene, causing a Val-->Ala amino acid substitution. The P50 measured in full blood indicated that this mutant has an elevated oxygen affinity. This is the fourth single nucleotide substitution at codon 23 of the beta gene and the second associated with erythrocytosis. Because the family was not available for investigation no information was obtained as to whether the mutation represents a de novo event or was inherited, and might be a more common cause of erythrocytosis in Dutch patients. Considering the relatively high frequency of beta-thalassemia (thal) in the large allochthonous population in The Netherlands, combinations of Hb Zoeterwoude and beta-thal traits may lead to hemizygosity, with severe hypoxia and erythrocytosis from a few months after birth.

15680411|t|DNA repair gene polymorphisms in relation to chromosome aberration frequencies in retired radiation workers.
15680411|a|Polymorphic variation in DNA repair genes was examined in a group of retired workers from the British Nuclear Fuels plc facility at Sellafield in relation to previously determined translocation frequencies in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Variation at seven polymorphisms in four genes involved in the base excision repair (XRCC1 R194W, R399Q and a [AC]n microsatellite in the 3' UTR) and double strand break repair (XRCC3 T241M and a [AC]n microsatellite in intron 3 of XRCC3, XRCC4 I134T, and a GACTAn microsatellite located 120 kb 5' of XRCC5) pathways was determined for 291 retired radiation workers who had received cumulative occupational external radiation doses of between 0 and 1873 mSv. When the interaction between radiation dose and each DNA repair gene polymorphism was examined in relation to translocation frequency there was no evidence for any of the polymorphisms studied influencing the response to occupational exposure. A positive interaction observed between genotype (individuals with at least one allele > or =20 repeat units) at a microsatellite locus in the XRCC3 gene and smoking status should be interpreted cautiously because interactions were investigated for seven polymorphisms and two exposures. Nonetheless, further research is warranted to examine whether this DNA repair gene variant might be associated with a sub-optimal repair response to smoking-induced DNA damage and hence an increased frequency of translocations.

15649253|t|Primary malignant lymphoma of the brain: frequent abnormalities and inactivation of p14 tumor suppressor gene.
15649253|a|Ten primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL, brain lymphomas) were examined for p14 gene exon 1beta deletion, mutation and methylation by Southern blot analysis, nucleotide analysis of polymerase chain reaction clones and Southern blot-based methylation assay. In Southern blot analysis, from the signal densities of the hybridized bands and their similarities to those of exons 2 and 3 in our previous quantitative study, we found that exon 1beta was homozygously deleted in four cases, hemizygously deleted in five cases and not deleted in one case. Thus, the same deletion patterns covered the entire p14 gene for all cases except for one case, which suggested the hemizygous deletion of exons 1beta and 2 and homozygous deletion of exon 3. In addition, although exon 1beta mutation is rare in various tumors, we detected a missense mutation (L50R) in one case with a hemizygous deletion. Methylation of the 5'CpG island of the p14 gene was not suggested for any case without homozygous deletion. Our observation of frequent p14 gene abnormalities (90%) and inactivation (40-60%) was in striking contrast to the same pathological subtype of systemic lymphoma in which p14 gene abnormalities and inactivation were infrequent, suggesting a difference in carcinogenesis between PCNSL and systemic lymphoma.

15609295|t|Compound heterozygosity for a novel nine-nucleotide deletion and the Asn45Ser missense mutation in the glycoprotein IX gene in a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome.
15609295|a|Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder due to quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex, the major von Willebrand factor receptor. The complex comprises four subunits, each encoded by a separate gene. Several mutations have been described for each of the subunits, except for GPV, as a cause of BSS. We describe here the genetic basis of the disorder in a child with BSS. Flow-cytometric analysis of the patient's platelets showed a markedly reduced surface expression of all three glycoproteins of the GPIb/IX/V complex. DNA sequencing analysis showed the patient to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the GPIX gene, a novel nine-nucleotide deletion starting at position 1952 of the gene that changes asparagine 86 for alanine and eliminates amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline) and a previously reported point mutation that changes the codon asparagine (AAC) for serine (AGC) at residue 45. Her mother was heterozygous for the Asn45Ser mutation, and her father, for the nine-nucleotide deletion. Our findings suggest that the additive effects of both mutations in the GPIX gene are responsible for the BSS phenotype of the patient.

15607529|t|Leydig cell hypoplasia due to inactivation of luteinizing hormone receptor by a novel homozygous nonsense truncation mutation in the seventh transmembrane domain.
15607529|a|Inactivating mutations in the LH receptor are the predominant cause for male pseudohermaphroditism in subjects with Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH). The severity of the mutations, correlates with residual receptor activities. Here, we detail the clinical presentation of one subject with complete male pseudohermaphroditism and LCH. We identify within the proband and her similarly afflicted sibling a homozygous T to G transversion at nucleotide 1836 in exon 11 of the LH/CGR gene. This causes conversion of a tyrosine codon into a stop codon at codon 612 in the seventh transmembrane domain, resulting in a truncated receptor that lacks a cytoplasmic tail. In vitro, in contrast to cells expressing a normal LHR, cells transfected with the mutant cDNA exhibit neither surface binding of radiolabeled hCG nor cAMP generation. In vitro expression under the control of the LHR signal peptide of either a wild type or mutant LHR-GFP fusion protein shows no differences in receptor cellular localization. In conclusion, the in vitro studies suggest that residues in the seventh transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail are important for receptor binding and activation without playing a major role in receptor cellular trafficking.

15353880|t|Fabry disease female proband with clinical manifestations similar to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
15353880|a|Fabry's disease is an X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, resulting from a deficiency in alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A). A 56-year-old Japanese woman was at first suspected of having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient and her son had alpha-Gal A activity in leukocytes that was remarkably below the limit of controls. DNA analysis of the alpha-Gal A gene revealed a novel missense mutation at codon 19 in exon 1, resulting in leucine-to-proline substitution. As a result she was confirmed as a classic Fabry heterozygote. Recent advances in enzyme replacement therapy can reverse the storage of glycosphingolipids in Fabry's disease. Thus, in patients with cardiac hypertrophy, it is important to differentiate Fabry's disease from other causes of hypertrophy. Therefore, it is necessary to measure alpha-Gal A activity in all suspected cases and to analyze genetic abnormalities in heterozygotes.

15316799|t|Genetic variation in apolipoprotein D and Alzheimer's disease.
15316799|a|Apolipoprotein D (apoD) is a lipoprotein-associated glycoprotein, structurally unrelated to apoE, that transports small hydrophobic ligands including cholesterol and sterols. Levels are increased in the hippocampus and CSF of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We tested whether variation in the APOD gene affects AD risk. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated (in map order): exon 2, 15T-->C encodes an amino acid substitution Phe-->Ser at codon 15; intron 2, -352G-->A; intron 3, +45C-->T; intron 4, +718C-->T, determined by SNaPshot assay. SNP frequencies for 394 eastern Finnish AD patients were compared with those found for 470 control subjects, dividing subjects also into early-onset AD (EOAD; < or = 65 years) and late-onset AD (LOAD; >65 years) groups. The -352G allele was associated with a significant 3-fold increase in the risk of EOAD (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1-6.5). The -352G containing haplotypes were more common for EOAD cases (TGCC: 0.48 vs 0.41; TGCT: 0.08 vs 0.01 (p = 0.002). In the Grade-of-membership analysis, APOD genotype frequencies at each SNP site and disease status were used to construct two latent groups: the affected group carried -352 as GG or GA and +45 CC, was often women and enriched in APOE epsilon4. Each method suggested that the -352G allele frequency is higher for EOAD in the eastern Finnish population.

15205584|a|We analyzed the factor XII (FXII) gene of a patient with congenital FXII deficiency and identified a novel amino acid substitution (W486C) in the catalytic domain. The proband was an asymptomatic 49-year-old Japanese female with abnormal coagulation test, discovered by chance. The FXII activity and antigen level were both under 10%, suggesting a cross-reacting material-negative FXII deficiency. Sequence analysis of the proband's FXII gene revealed a homozygous nucleotide substitution G --> C in exon 12, resulting in the amino acid substitution W486C in the catalytic domain. We constructed the mutant FXII cDNA in an expression plasmid vector and transfected it into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The recombinant wild-type FXII antigen was detected in the culture medium by immunoprecipitation assay, but the mutant FXII (W486C) was not observed. On the other hand, both the wild-type FXII and W486C cell lysates contained FXII antigen and FXII mRNA, as estimated by western blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. These findings suggest that the W486C substitution of FXII impairs intracellular processing of the protein and/or transport system.

15200408|t|Lack of major involvement of human uroplakin genes in vesicoureteral reflux: implications for disease heterogeneity.
15200408|a|BACKGROUND: Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the retrograde flow of urine into the ureters and kidneys. It affects about 1% of the young children and is thus one of the most common hereditary diseases. Its associated nephropathy is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in children and adults. Recent studies indicate that genetic ablation of mouse uroplakin (UP) III gene, which encodes a 47 kD urothelial-specific integral membrane protein forming urothelial plaques, causes VUR and hydronephrosis. METHODS: To begin to determine whether mutations in UP genes might play a role in human VUR, we genotyped all four UP genes in 76 patients with radiologically proven primary VUR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of all their exons plus 50 to 150 bp of flanking intronic sequences. RESULTS: Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, seven of which were missense, with no truncation or frame shift mutations. Since healthy relatives of the VUR probands are not reliable negative controls for VUR, we used a population of 90 race-matched, healthy individuals, unrelated to the VUR patients, as controls to perform an association study. Most of the SNPs were not found to be significantly associated with VUR. However, SNP1 of UP Ia gene affecting a C to T conversion and an Ala7Val change, and SNP7 of UP III affecting a C to G conversion and a Pro154Ala change, were marginally associated with VUR (both P= 0.08). Studies of additional cases yielded a second set of data that, in combination with the first set, confirmed a weak association of UP III SNP7 in VUR (P= 0.036 adjusted for both subsets of cases vs. controls). CONCLUSION: Such a weak association and the lack of families with simple dominant Mendelian inheritance suggest that missense changes of uroplakin genes cannot play a dominant role in causing VUR in humans, although they may be weak risk factors contributing to a complex polygenic disease. The fact that no truncation or frame shift mutations have been found in any of the VUR patients, coupled with our recent finding that some breeding pairs of UP III knockout mice yield litters that show not only VUR, but also severe hydronephrosis and neonatal death, raises the possibility that major uroplakin mutations could be embryonically or postnatally lethal in humans.

15198485|t|Evaluation of the Lys198Asn and -134delA genetic polymorphisms of the endothelin-1 gene.
15198485|a|Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and shows various pharmacological responses. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ET-1 gene (EDN1) have been reported to be associated with blood pressure (BP). One is the Lys198Asn polymorphism, which showed a positive association with BP in overweight people. Another is the 3A/4A polymorphism (-134delA) located in the 5'-untranslated region. In this study, we investigated the expression of the Lys198Asn polymorphism in ET-1 in vitro, as well as the association between either of the two polymorphisms and the plasma ET-1 level. We expressed both the major (Lys-type) and minor type (Asn-type) preproET-1 in three different cell lines, and measured the levels of ET-1 and big ET-1 in the culture supernatant. There was no significant difference in the levels of ET-1 or big ET-1 between the Asn-type and Lys-type transfectant. In the association study, the plasma levels of ET-1 in 54 hypertensive patients having an amino acid substitution from Lys to Asn at position 198 were not different from those of hypertensives without the substitution. However, we found a significant difference in ET-1 levels between individuals with the 3A/3A and 3A/4A genotypes. Our transient expression study indicates that the Lys198Asn polymorphism may not directly affect ET-1 and big ET-1 production. Another variant in the EDN1 gene in linkage disequilibrium with the Lys198Asn polymorphism may be responsible for the association with BP, or the interaction between the EDN1 Lys198Asn polymorphism and other factors such as obesity may be involved in the mechanisms elevating BP in vivo.

15122708|t|Desmin-related myopathy with Mallory body-like inclusions is caused by mutations of the selenoprotein N gene.
15122708|a|Desmin-related myopathies (DRMs) are a heterogeneous group of muscle disorders, morphologically defined by intrasarcoplasmic aggregates of desmin. Mutations in the desmin and the alpha-B crystallin genes account for approximately one third of the DRM cases. The genetic basis of the other forms remain unknown, including the early-onset, recessive form with Mallory body-like inclusions (MB-DRMs), first described in five related German patients. Recently, we identified the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1) as responsible for SEPN-related myopathy (SEPN-RM), a unique early-onset myopathy formerly divided in two different nosological categories: rigid spine muscular dystrophy and the severe form of classical multiminicore disease. The finding of Mallory body-like inclusions in two cases of genetically documented SEPN-RM led us to suspect a relationship between MB-DRM and SEPN1. In the original MB-DRM German family, we demonstrated a linkage of the disease to the SEPN1 locus (1p36), and subsequently a homozygous SEPN1 deletion (del 92 nucleotide -19/+73) in the affected patients. A comparative reevaluation showed that MB-DRM and SEPN-RM share identical clinical features. Therefore, we propose that MB-DRM should be categorized as SEPN-RM. These findings substantiate the molecular heterogeneity of DRM, expand the morphological spectrum of SEPN-RM, and implicate a necessary reassessment of the nosological boundaries in early-onset myopathies.

15111599|t|CRYBA3/A1 gene mutation associated with suture-sparing autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract: a novel phenotype.
15111599|a|PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect leading to the congenital nuclear cataract affecting a large five-generation Swiss family. METHODS: Family history and clinical data were recorded. The phenotype was documented by both slit lamp and Scheimpflug photography. One cortical lens was evaluated by electron microscopy after cataract extraction. Lenticular phenotyping and genotyping were performed independently with short tandem repeat polymorphism. Linkage analysis was performed, and candidate genes were PCR amplified and screened for mutations on both strands using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Affected individuals had a congenital nuclear lactescent cataract in both eyes. Linkage was observed on chromosome 17 for DNA marker D17S1857 (lod score: 3.44 at theta = 0). Direct sequencing of CRYBA3/A1, which maps to the vicinity, revealed an in-frame 3-bp deletion in exon 4 (279delGAG). This mutation involved a deletion of glycine-91, cosegregated in all affected individuals, and was not observed in unaffected individuals or in 250 normal control subjects from the same ethnic background. Electron microscopy showed that cortical lens fiber morphology was normal. CONCLUSIONS: The DeltaG91 mutation in CRYBA3/A1 is associated with an autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract. A splice mutation (IVS3+1G/A) in this gene has been reported in a zonular cataract with sutural opacities. These results indicate phenotypic heterogeneity related to mutations in this gene.

15041272|t|A first Taiwanese Chinese family of type 2B von Willebrand disease with R1306W mutation.
15041272|a|Clinical, laboratory and genetic defect of a Taiwanese family with type 2B von Willebrand disease (VWD) were studied. The proband was a 55-year-old woman who gave birth to two daughters and one son aged 30, 29 and 27, respectively. All had abnormal mucocutaneous bleedings since their childhood. In proband, PT, PTT and platelet count were normal; template bleeding time was 14 min; VIII:C was 51%, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), 42% and von Willerand factor ristocetin-cofactor (VWF:RCo, 15%); ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) at 0.3 and 0.6 mg/ml of ristocetin was 16% and 68%, respectively. The enhanced response to ristocetin was identified to be in plasma, not in platelet itself, by mixing studies. Analysis of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer of plasma but not of platelets showed absence of high-molecular weight (HMW) multimer. All three children had similar laboratory findings. Exon 28 of VWF gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. The proband and three children were all found to be heterozygous for C to T transition at nucleotide 3916 resulting in Arg 1306 Trp (R1306W) substitution. This mutation in the glycoprotein Ib (GPIb)-binding site has been found to increase the affinity of plasma VWF for platelets, and thus cause loss of HMW multimers and often thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, a first report of type 2B VWD in a Taiwanese Chinese family who show R1306W mutation in VWF gene was described.

15018851|t|Comparison of sequential cytomegalovirus isolates in a patient with lymphoma and failing antiviral therapy.
15018851|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) treatments in immunocompromised patients are hampered by resistance to antiviral drugs. Longitudinal changes in the resistance genotype may depend on changes in selective pressure and the complexity of CMV isolates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal changes in the CMV resistance genotype and phenotype along with strain-specific variability in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in whom successive anti-CMV treatments failed. STUDY DESIGN: The resistance phenotype and genotype of seven CMV isolates collected from one patient during a 2-year follow-up period were retrospectively analysed. In parallel, we used glycoprotein B (gB) genotyping, and a- and UL10-13-sequence analysis to study CMV interstrain variability. RESULTS: The patient was infected by at least three CMV strains plus variants of the parental strains. Resistance to ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet was successively detected during the follow-up period. UL97 protein kinase changes responsible for resistance to ganciclovir were initially detected at residues 591 and 592, and then at position 594. Decreased sensitivity to foscarnet coincided with the appearance of amino acid substitution N495K in DNA polymerase, whereas cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir was due to the L501I substitution. CONCLUSIONS: The CMV isolates obtained from our patient were complex mixtures of strains. Changes in resistance genotypes depended on resistance selective pressure and were not linked to interstrain variation.

15003823|t|Molecular analysis of acute intermittent porphyria: mutation screening in 20 patients in Germany reveals 11 novel mutations.
15003823|a|Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a very rare autosomal dominant disorder with low penetrance. Mutations in the gene of the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D), also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), cause a partial deficiency of this enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. Overstimulation of heme biosynthesis causes clinical symptoms. Because of the variability of the symptoms, diagnosis is often delayed. Using two approaches for genetic analysis, first in a stepwise manner, then sequencing extensive parts of the gene, the screening of the DNA of 20 unrelated individuals revealed 20 different mutations, 11 of which had not been reported previously. The novel mutations affected intron 1 (33 + 2 T-->C), exon 5 (181 G-->C), intron 6 (267-61 del 8 bp), intron 7 (345-1 G-->C), intron 9 (498 + 15 G-->T and 499-13 Delta-14 bp indel TGA), intron 13 (825 + 1 G-->C and 825 + 2 T-->C), exon 15 (962 G-A, 1067 del A and 1067-1068 ins 5 bp). The other nine mutations detected affected intron 14, exons 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (3x) and 12. In the majority of AIP patients, the genotype does not predict phenotypic expression. Since the sudden manifestation of the disease maybe prevented by early diagnosis, identification of AIP gene carriers is the best preventive measure. This was performed in five families, revealing 10 additional AIP gene carriers.

14962306|t|Identification of the Kna/Knb polymorphism and a method for Knops genotyping.
14962306|a|BACKGROUND: DNA mutations resulting in the McCoy and Swain-Langley polymorphisms have been identified on complement receptor 1 (CR1)-a ligand for rosetting of Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs. The molecular identification of the Kna/Knb polymorphism was sought to develop a genotyping method for use in the study of the Knops blood group and malaria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: CR1 deletion constructs were used in inhibition studies of anti-Kna. PCR amplification of Exon 29 was followed by DNA sequencing. A PCR-RFLP was developed with NdeI, BsmI, and MfeI for the detection of Kna/Knb, McCa/McCb, and Sl1/Sl2, respectively. Knops phenotypes were determined with standard serologic techniques. RESULTS: A total of 310 Malian persons were phenotyped for Kna with 200 (64%) Kn(a+) and 110 (36%) Kn(a-). Many of the Kn(a-) exhibited the Knops-null phenotype, that is, Helgeson. The Kna/b DNA polymorphism was identified as a V1561M mutation with allele frequencies of Kna (V1561) 0.9 and Knb (M1561) 0.1. CONCLUSION: The high frequency (18%) of Knb in West African persons suggests that it is not solely a Caucasian trait. Furthermore, because of the high incidence of heterozygosity as well as amorphs, accurate Knops typing of donors of African descent is best accomplished by a combination of molecular and serologic techniques.

14722925|t|Two novel severe mutations in the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene (SPINK1) cause familial and/or hereditary pancreatitis.
14722925|a|Mutations in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 gene (SPINK1) encoding pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) have recently been found to be associated with chronic pancreatitis. Nevertheless, knowledge of severe mutations is particularly scarce, both in terms of number and in the extent of clinical information. The aim of this study was to expand the known spectrum of such mutations. 46 unrelated families, each including at least two pancreatitis patients and carrying neither cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) mutations nor the frequent SPINK1 N34S mutation, participated in this study. The four exons and their flanking sequences of the SPINK1 gene were screened by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis (DHPLC); and mutations were identified by direct sequencing. A heterozygous microdeletion mutation (c.27delC), which occurs within a symmetric element, was identified in two families. In one family, c.27delC showed segregation with the disease across two generations, with a penetrance of up to 75%. But in the other family, however, the same mutation manifested as a low-penetrance susceptibility factor. In addition, a novel heterozygous splicing mutation, c.87+1G>A (G>A substitution at nucleotide +1 of intron 2) was found in one family with familial pancreatitis. Our results also helped to resolve the sharply differing views about PSTI's role in pancreatitis.

14708104|t|Gonadal mosaicism in severe Pallister-Hall syndrome.
14708104|a|Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS, MIM #146510) is characterized by central and postaxial polydactyly, hypothalamic hamartoma (HH), bifid epiglottis, imperforate anus, renal abnormalities, and pulmonary segmentation anomalies. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Here, we describe a family with two affected children manifesting severe PHS with mental retardation, behavioral problems, and intractable seizures. Both parents are healthy, with normal intelligence, and have no malformations on physical, laryngoscopic, and cranial MRI exam. The atypical presentation of these children and the absence of parental manifestations suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance or gonadal mosaicism. Sequencing of GLI3 revealed a two nucleotide deletion in exon 15 (c.3385_3386delTT) predicting a frameshift and premature stop at codon 1129 (p.F1129X) in the children while both parents have wild type alleles. Genotyping with GLI3 intragenic markers revealed that both children inherited the abnormal allele from their mother thus supporting gonadal mosaicism as the underlying mechanism of inheritance (paternity was confirmed). This is the first reported case of gonadal mosaicism in PHS. The severe CNS manifestations of these children are reminiscent of children with non-syndromic HH who often have progressive mental retardation with behavioral problems and intractable seizures. We conclude that the phenotypic spectrum of PHS can include severe CNS manifestations and that recurrence risks for PHS should include a proviso for gonadal mosaicism, though the frequency cannot be calculated from a single case report.

14568816|t|Muscle glycogenosis and mitochondrial hepatopathy in an infant with mutations in both the myophosphorylase and deoxyguanosine kinase genes.
14568816|a|OBJECTIVES: To document 2 apparently incongruous clinical disorders occurring in the same infant: congenital myopathy with myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and mitochondrial hepatopathy with liver failure and mitochondrial DNA depletion. METHODS: An infant girl born to consanguineous Moroccan parents had severe congenital hypotonia and hepatomegaly, developed liver failure, and died at 5 months of age. We studied muscle and liver biopsy specimens histochemically and biochemically, and we sequenced the whole coding regions of the deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and myophosphorylase (PYGM) genes. RESULTS: Muscle biopsy specimens showed subsarcolemmal glycogen accumulation and negative histochemical reaction for phosphorylase. Liver biopsy specimens showed micronodular cirrhosis and massive mitochondrial proliferation. Biochemical analysis showed phosphorylase deficiency in muscle and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in liver. We identified a novel homozygous missense G-to-A mutation at codon 456 in exon 11 of PYGM, as well as a homozygous 4-base pair GATT duplication (nucleotides 763-766) in exon 6 of dGK, which produces a frame shift and a premature TGA stop codon at nucleotides 766 to 768, resulting in a truncated 255-amino acid protein. Both mutations were absent in 100 healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data further expand the genetic heterogeneity in patients with McArdle disease; confirm the strong relationship between mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, liver involvement, and dGK mutations; and suggest that genetic "double trouble" should be considered in patients with unusual severe phenotypes.

12915882|t|Association of microsomal epoxide hydrolase polymorphisms and lung cancer risk.
12915882|a|Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) plays a dual role in the detoxification and activation of tobacco procarcinogens. Two polymorphisms affecting enzyme activity have been described in the exons 3 and 4 of the mEH gene, which result in the substitution of amino acids histidine to tyrosine at residue 113, and arginine to histidine at residue 139, respectively. We performed a hospital-based case-control study consisting of 277 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients and 496 control subjects to investigate a possible association between these two polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. The polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism and TaqMan assay using DNA from peripheral white blood cells. Logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs), confidence limits (CL) and to control for possible confounders. The exon 3 polymorphism of the mEH gene was associated with a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer. The adjusted OR, calculated relative to subjects with the Tyr113/Tyr113 wild type, for the His113/His113 genotype was 0.38 (95% CL 0.20-0.75). An analysis according to histological subtypes revealed a statistically significant association for adenocarcinomas; the adjusted OR for the His113/His113 genotype was 0.40 (95% CL 0.17-0.94). In contrast, no relationship between the exon 4 polymorphism and lung cancer risk was found. The adjusted OR, calculated relative to the His139/His139 wild type, was for the Arg139/Arg139 genotype 1.83 (0.76-4.44). Our results support the hypothesis that genetically reduced mEH activity may be protective against lung cancer.

12862311|t|Detection of PHKA2 gene mutation in four Japanese patients with hepatic phosphorylase kinase deficiency.
12862311|a|We analyzed the PHKA2 gene in four Japanese families with hepatic phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency. Mutational analysis of PHKA2 cDNA was performed by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing, and each mutation was confirmed on the genomic DNA. In boys with low erythrocyte PhK activity (i.e., x-linked liver glycogenosis [XLG] type I), deletion of exon 2 (splice site mutation of 79-1 G > T) or nonsense mutation of Q1169X or R497X was identified. However, missense mutation of R295C was identified in one boy with normal erythrocyte PhK activity (i.e., XLG type II). This mutation was not found in 100 control alleles, and was considered responsible for presentation of the XLG type II phenotype. Excluding Q1169X, all mutations detected in this study represented novel mutations. All mothers were found to be heterozygous carriers of the mutations. Gene analysis was confirmed to represent a useful procedure for diagnosing XLG type II, for which liver biopsy had previously been required to detect hepatic PhK deficiency.

12820697|t|Mutation analysis of SLC7A9 in cystinuria patients in Sweden.
12820697|a|Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased urinary excretion of cystine and dibasic amino acids, which cause recurrent stone formation in affected individuals. Three subtypes of cystinuria have been described (type I, II, and III): type I is caused by mutations in the SLC3A1 gene, whereas nontype I (II and III) has been associated with SLC7A9 mutations. Of the 53 patients reported in our previous work, patients that showed SLC7A9 mutations in single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) screening and/or either lacked or showed heterozygosity for SLC3A1 mutations were included in the present study. The entire coding region and the exon/intron boundaries of the SLC7A9 gene were analyzed by means of both SSCP and DNA sequencing in 16 patients, all but one of which were clinically diagnosed as homozygous cystinurics. Three novel SLC7A9 mutations were identified in the patient group: two missense mutations (P261L and V330M), and one single base-pair deletion (1009 delA). We also detected the previously reported A182T and nine novel polymorphisms in the patients. Mutations V330M and 1009delA occurred on different alleles in one individual, and we suggest that these mutations cause cystinuria in this patient. One patient that was homozygously mutated in the SLC3A1 gene carried the third novel mutation (P261L). We conclude that SLC3A1 is still the major disease gene among Swedish cystinuria patients, with only a minor contribution of SLC7A9 mutations as the genetic basis of cystinuria. The absence of SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 mutations in a substantial proportion of the patients implies that mutations in parts of the genes that were not analyzed may be present, as well as large deletions that escape detection by the methods used. However, our results raise the question of whether other, as yet unknown genes, may also be involved in cystinuria.

12791036|t|A cluster of autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis caused by three newly identified DLL3 mutations segregating in a small village.
12791036|a|In 1982, one of us reported a cluster of eight individuals affected by spondylocostal dysostosis (SD, MIM 277300) in four nuclear families indigenous to a village from eastern Switzerland. We tested the hypothesis that the molecular basis for this cluster was segregation of a single mutation in the DLL3 gene, recently linked to SD. Marker haplotypes around the DLL3 locus contradicted this hypothesis as three different haplotypes were seen in affected individuals, but sequence analysis showed that three unreported DLL3 mutations were segregating: a duplication of 17 bp in exon 8 (c.1285-1301dup), a single-nucleotide deletion in exon 5 (c.615delC), and a R238X nonsense mutation in exon 6. Contrary to our initial assumption of a single allele segregating in this small community, three different pathogenic alleles were observed, with a putative founder mutation occurring at the homozygous state but also compounding with, and thus revealing, two other independent mutations. As all three mutations predict truncation of the DLL3 protein and loss of the membrane-attaching domain, the results confirm that autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis represents the null phenotype of DLL3, with remarkable phenotypic consistency across families.

12737948|t|A "null allele" mutation is responsible for erythropoietic protoporphyria in an Israeli patient who underwent liver transplantation: relationships among biochemical, clinical, and genetic parameters.
12737948|a|Mutations in the human ferrochelatase gene (FECH) are the primary cause of the inborn disorder erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). While the majority of the EPP patients exhibit only photosensitivity, a small percentage of patients (approximately 2%) develop liver complications in addition to the cutaneous symptoms. In this study, the FECH gene of an Israeli EPP patient who suffered from EPP-related liver complications was sequenced. A splicing defect IVS10+1, g-->t, which is known to cause the deletion of exon 10, was identified in the index patient as well as in his symptomatic older sister and his asymptomatic mother. Like the other 12 known FECH mutations associated with liver complications, IVS10+1, g-->t is a "null-allele" mutation. Although the two siblings with overt EPP share an identical genotype with respect to both the mutation on one FECH allele and three intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms, -251G, IVS1-23T, and IVS3-48C on the other allele, the sister of the index patient has so far shown no signs of liver involvement, suggesting that additional factors might account for the liver disease in EPP.

12701064|t|A novel compound heterozygous mutation in the CYP17 (P450 17alpha-hydroxylase) gene leading to 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.
12701064|a|Mutations in the CYP17 gene impair steroid biosynthesis in the adrenals and gonads and often cause 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, leading to amenorrhea, sexual infantilism, and hypokalemic low aldosterone hypertension. Several CYP17 mutations resulting in 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency have been reported previously. In the present study, we found a novel CYP17 mutation from the molecular analysis of a Korean patient with primary amenorrhea with a 46,XX karyotype, and hypokalemic hypertension. We sequenced all 8 exons of the CYP17 gene that were amplified from patient's genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and found a compound heterozygous mutation in the CYP17 structural gene; a 1-base deletion and a 1-base transversion (TAC-->AA) at codon 329, leading to the production of a truncated protein (1-417 amino acids), and a 3-base deletion (TCC, either 350-351 or 351-352 codon) in the other allele. Restriction enzyme digestion analysis of patient's and parental DNA showed that the 1-base deletion and the 3-base deletion are inherited from mother and father, respectively. Here we conclude that these novel compound heterozygous mutations might account for the patient's clinical manifestations of 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.

12668609|t|Haplotypes extending across ACE are associated with Alzheimer's disease.
12668609|a|Numerous genes have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but, with the exception of a demonstrated association with the epsilon 4 allele of APOE, findings have not been consistently replicated across populations. One of the most widely studied is the gene for angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE ). A meta-analysis of published data on a common Alu indel polymorphism in ACE was performed which indicated highly significant association of the insertion allele with AD (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.19 - 1.41; P=4 x 10(-8)). To further explore the influence of ACE on AD, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in five independent populations represented by over 3100 individuals. Analyses based upon single markers and haplotypes revealed strong evidence of association in case-control models and also in a model examining the influence of variation in ACE upon cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta42 peptide (Abeta42). The most significant evidence for association with AD was found for an SNP, A-262T, located in the ACE promoter (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.33 -1.94; P=2 x 10(-5)). Estimates of population attributable risk for the common allele of this SNP suggest that it, or an allele in tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) with it, may contribute to as much as 35% of AD in the general population. Results support a model whereby decreased ACE activity may influence AD susceptibility by a mechanism involving beta-amyloid metabolism.

12636044|t|Identification of new polymorphisms in the CACNA1S gene.
12636044|a|We identified four novel polymorphisms in the CACNA1S gene that encodes the alpha1-subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor. Mutations in this gene are associated with two genetic diseases: malignant hyperthermia and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. The nucleotide substitutions c2403T --> C and c5398T --> C did not result in amino acid replacement, the nucleotide substitution c4475C --> A caused the replacement of the Ala1492 with an Asp residue and an A insertion was identified in intron 36. By using methods based on digestion with restriction enzymes we calculated the frequencies of these novel polymorphisms, as well as heterozygosity, in normal subjects from southern Italy.

12631337|t|Association of an IL-1A 3'UTR polymorphism with end-stage renal disease and IL-1 alpha expression.
12631337|a|BACKGROUND: We evaluated polymorphisms in the interleukin-1 alpha 3'-untranslated region (IL-1A 3'[UTR]) for association with type 2 diabetes-associated (DM) and nondiabetic-associated (non-DM) end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in two ethnic groups. METHODS: IL-1A 3'UTR polymorphisms were identified by alignment of overlapping human expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Sequence ambiguities were experimentally confirmed and variants genotyped to test for association with ESRD in 75 unrelated Caucasians with DM ESRD, 95 unrelated Caucasian controls and, in a parallel study, 92 unrelated African Americans with type 2 DM ESRD, 95 unrelated African Americans with non-DM ESRD, and 86 unrelated African American controls. IL-1A 3' UTR genotype and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-1 alpha protein levels were measured in healthy Caucasians (N = 112) and African Americans (N = 101) to evaluate association between genotype and protein level. RESULTS: A polymorphism in the 3' UTR of the human IL-1A gene was associated with ESRD and IL-1 alpha protein expression. The polymorphism consists of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an insertion/deletion generating four different haplotypes: TN7TTCAA, AN7TTCAA, TN7TTCAG and an allele deleted for four internal bases, TN7(delTTCA)A. The 4 bp deletion allele, TN7(delTTCA)A, was significantly less common among Caucasian DM ESRD and African American non-DM ESRD patients (recessive model; P = 0.0364 and P = 0.0293, respectively). In vitro, this polymorphism is associated with the amount of IL-1 alpha protein synthesized in LPS-stimulated lymphocytes from healthy subjects (P = 0.0013, additive model), with the TN7(delTTCA)A haplotype associated with higher levels of stimulated IL-1 alpha. CONCLUSION: The association of the TN7(delTTCA)A haplotype with higher levels of IL-1 alpha expression and reduced risk for ESRD is consistent with involvement of cytokines in risk for developing nephropathy.

22106692|t|The association between GJB2 mutation and GJB6 gene in non syndromic hearing loss school children.
22106692|a|Recently, molecular testing for GJB2 mutations has become the standard of care for the diagnosis of patients with non syndromic hearing impairment of unknown cause. The aims of this study are to determine the association between GJB2 mutation and GJB6 and to report the variation of mutations in deaf students who have heterozygous GJB2. This retrospective study was conducted at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC). Data was collected from previous files and records from Tissue Engineering and Human Genetic Research Group Laboratory. Approval from Ethical Committee was obtained prior to the study. A total of 138 students have been screened in previous studies in UKMMC for the presence of GJB2 mutations as a cause for hearing loss. Thirty four of the 138 subjects have GJB2 mutations; 2 showed homozygous mutations whereas another 32 were heterozygous for GJB2 gene mutation. Only 31 DNA samples of students presented with sensorineural hearing loss with heterozygous mutation in GJB2 gene were included in this study. The sequencing results obtained were analyzed. The degree of hearing loss of those students with association between GJB2 mutation and GJB6 mutation will be discussed. Five out of 31 subjects (16.2%) have mutations in their GJB6 gene, suggesting a digenic inheritance of GJB2/GJB6 mutation. In total, four novel mutations were identified; E137D (n=1), R32Q (n=1), E101K (n=1) and Y156H (n=1) and one mutation deletion; 366delT (n=1). All students with association GJB2 mutation and GJB6 showed severe to profound hearing loss in both ears. Interestingly this study not detected the large deletion of 342 kb in GJB6 gene suggesting that the mutation is very rare in this region compared to certain parts of the world.

21699520|t|PTCH1 gene mutations in exon 17 and loss of heterozygosity on D9S180 microsatellite in sporadic and inherited human basal cell carcinomas.
21699520|a|BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most frequent human cancer that results from malignant transformation of basal cells in the epidermis. Gorlin syndrome is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disease that predisposes with multiple BCCs and other birth defects. Both sporadic and inherited BCCs are associated with mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1, but there is still uncertainty on the role of its homolog PTCH2. OBJECTIVES: To search for mutations and genomic instability in sporadic and inherited BCCs. METHODS: DNA obtained from leukocytes and tumor cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction regarding five exons of PTCH1 and PTCH2 and neighboring microsatellites. Exons were sequenced and compared with the GenBank database. RESULTS: Only D9S180, of six microsatellites, showed loss of heterozygosity in three BCCs (two sporadic and one inherited). One sporadic BCC presented the mutation g.2885G>C in exon 17 of PTCH1, which predicts the substitution p.R962T in an external domain of the protein. In addition, the leukocytes and tumor cells of one patient with Gorlin syndrome showed the mutation g.2839T>G in the same exon and gene, which predicts a p.E947stop and truncated protein. All control and tumor samples presented IVS9 + 217T in intron 9 of PTCH1. CONCLUSION: Mutations found in the PTCH1 gene and neighboring repetitive sequences may have contributed to the development of the studied BCCs.

21542403|t|Chasing the ubiquitous RET proto-oncogene in South African MEN2 families--implications for the surgeon.
21542403|a|The RET proto-oncogene (REarranged during Transfection; RET) plays an important role in the causation of many thyroid tumours. Germline RET proto-oncogene missense mutations have been clearly linked to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2A, MEN2B). METHODS: We investigated a cohort of MEN2-related patients referred to Tygerberg Hospital, W Cape (2003-2009). The study cohort was divided into three groups based on pathology (viz. MEN/MTC, phaeochromocytoma, and a miscellaneous group of MEN pathologies). Families with identified high-risk factors were recalled. Serum calcitonin levels were monitored where indicated. DNA was extracted from whole blood by standard techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products screened for RET gene variations by heteroduplex single-strand duplication techniques (heteroduplex single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis) being validated with automated sequencing techniques showing conformational variants in acrylamide gel. RESULTS: We screened 40 persons, male/female ratio 1:1.5. Three ethnic groups were represented (white (12), black (11) and mixed race (17)). Nine were index MTC cases, 5 phaeochromocytoma, 3 Hirschsprung's disease-MEN associations and 2 miscellaneous (1 neuroblastoma, 1 intestinal neuronal dysplasia), while 1 fell into the MEN2B category. The remaining 19 were unaffected relatives screened for carrier status, among whom afamilial recurrence was observed in 7. On genetic testing, an RET point mutation at the high-risk 634 cysteine allele was identified in 11 cases. A further cysteine radical mutation at the 620 position was related to MEN2 in 3 families plus 1 other family referred from elsewhere. Other less-recognised gene variations were detected throughout the RET gene in 70% of cases and included the 691 position on codon 11 (11 cases); the 432 position (4 cases, 1 homozygous) intronic mutations on exon 4 (1 case); and an IVS19-37G/C and a D1017N variation in exon 19 in 2 MEN families. Fifteen MTC patients have had thyroidectomies, of which 2 were prophylactic (C-cell hyperplasia; early occult MTC). A further 3 are awaiting prophylactic surgery. CONCLUSION: RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South Africa. Prophylactic surgery may prevent MTC, so genetic screening is important to identify and treat high-risk patients.

21903317|t|Autosomal dominant mutation in the signal peptide of renin in a kindred with anemia, hyperuricemia, and CKD.
21903317|a|Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in renin (REN) cause renal tubular dysgenesis, which is characterized by death in utero due to kidney failure and pulmonary hypoplasia. The phenotype resembles the fetopathy caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker intake during pregnancy. Recently, heterozygous REN mutations were shown to result in early-onset hyperuricemia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To date, only 3 different heterozygous REN mutations have been published. We report mutation analysis of the REN gene in 39 kindreds with hyperuricemia and CKD who previously tested negative for mutations in the UMOD (uromodulin) and HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b) genes. We identified one kindred with a novel thymidine to cytosine mutation at position 28 in the REN complementary DNA, corresponding to a tryptophan to arginine substitution at amino acid 10, which is found within the signal sequence (c.28T>C; p.W10R). On this basis, we conclude that REN mutations are rare events in patients with CKD. Within the kindred, we found affected individuals over 4 generations who carried the novel REN mutation and were characterized by significant anemia, hyperuricemia, and CKD. Anemia was severe and disproportional to the degree of decreased kidney function. Because all heterozygous REN mutations that have been described are localized in the signal sequence, screening of the REN gene for patients with CKD with hyperuricemia and anemia may best be focused on sequencing of exon 1, which encodes the signal peptide.

21666969|t|Roles of G1359A polymorphism of the cannabinoid receptor gene (CNR1) on weight loss and adipocytokines after a hypocaloric diet.
21666969|a|BACKGROUND: A intragenic biallelic polymorphism (1359 G/A) of the CB1 gene resulting in the substitution of the G to A at nucleotide position 1359 in codon 435 (Thr), was reported as a common polymorphism in Caucasian populations. Intervention studies with this polymorphism have not been realized. OBJECTIVE: We decided to investigate the role of the polymorphism (G1359A) of CB1 receptor gene on adipocytokines response and weight loss secondary to a lifestyle modification (Mediterranean hypocaloric diet and exercise) in obese patients. DESIGN: A population of 94 patients with obesity was analyzed. Before and after 3 months on a hypocaloric diet, an anthropometric evaluation, an assessment of nutritional intake and a biochemical analysis were performed. The statistical analysis was performed for the combined G1359A and A1359A as a group and wild type G1359G as second group, with a dominant model. Results: Forty seven patients (50%) had the genotype G1359G (wild type group) and 47 (50%) patients G1359A (41 patients, 43.6%) or A1359A (6 patients, 6.4%) (mutant type group) had the genotype. In wild and mutant type groups, weight, body mass index, fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased. In mutant type group, resistin (4.15    1.7 ng/ml vs. 3.90    2.1 ng/ml: P < 0.05), leptin (78.4    69 ng/ml vs 66.2    32 ng/ml: P < 0.05) and IL-6 (1.40    1.9 pg/ml vs 0.81    1.5 pg/ml: P < 0.05) levels decreased after dietary treatment. CONCLUSION: The novel finding of this study is the association of the mutant allele (A1359) with a decrease of resistin, leptin and interleukin-6 secondary to weight loss.

21684788|t|Large contiguous gene deletions in Sj  gren-Larsson syndrome.
21684788|a|Sj  gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity and mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehyde to fatty acid. More than 70 mutations have been identified in SLS patients, including small deletions or insertions, missense mutations, splicing defects and complex nucleotide changes. We now describe 2 SLS patients whose disease is caused by large contiguous gene deletions of the ALDH3A2 locus on 17p11.2. The deletions were defined using long distance inverse PCR and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. A 24-year-old SLS female was homozygous for a 352-kb deletion involving ALDH3A2 and 4 contiguous genes including ALDH3A1, which codes for the major soluble protein in cornea. Although lacking corneal disease, she showed severe symptoms of SLS with uncommon deterioration in oral motor function and loss of ambulation. The other 19-month-old female patient was a compound heterozygote for a 1.44-Mb contiguous gene deletion and a missense mutation (c.407C>T, P136L) in ALDH3A2. These studies suggest that large gene deletions may account for up to 5% of the mutant alleles in SLS. Geneticists should consider the possibility of compound heterozygosity for large deletions in patients with SLS and other inborn errors of metabolism, which has implications for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.

22042570|t|OPA1 mutations in Japanese patients suspected to have autosomal dominant optic atrophy.
22042570|a|PURPOSE: To report three types of heterozygous mutations in the OPA1 gene in five patients from three families with autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA, MIM#165500). METHODS: DNA was extracted from the leukocytes of the peripheral blood. For mtDNA, mutations were examined at positions 11778, 3460 and 14484. For the OPA1 gene, the exons were amplified by PCR and mutations were detected by restriction enzymes or the dye terminator method. RESULTS: We detected three types of OPA1 mutation but no mtDNA mutations. In the OPA1 gene, heterozygous frameshift mutations from codon 903 due to a four-base pair deletion in exon 27 were detected in three patients from one family (c.2708_2711delTTAG, p.V903GfsX905). A heterozygous mutation due to a three-base pair deletion in exon 17, leading to a one-amino acid deletion (c.1618_1620delACT, p.T540del), and a heterozygous mutation due to a one-base substitution in exon 11, leading to a stop codon (c.1084G>T, p.E362X), were detected in sporadic cases. CONCLUSION: OPA1 mutations existed in three Japanese families with ADOA. After a detailed clinical assessment of the proband, the screening of the OPA1 gene may be helpful for precise diagnosis of ADOA, provided the relevant information of the family members is limited.

21615796|t|Interleukin-17F gene polymorphism in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia.
21615796|a|INTRODUCTION: IL-17F is a novel inflammatory cytokine and plays an important role in some autoimmune diseases. We investigated the association between chronic ITP and the frequency of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs763780 (7488T/C), which causes a His-to-Arg substitution at amino acid 161. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 102 patients (men/women, 40/62; median age, 42) diagnosed with chronic ITP and 188 healthy controls (men/women, 78/110; median age, 38). Genotyping was determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients with chronic ITP had a significantly lower frequency of the IL-17F 7488CC genotype (0% vs. 4.8%, P<0.05). The number of IL-17F 7488C alleles among the patients with chronic ITP was also significantly lower than in the control group (8.7% vs. 15.2% OR=0.48, 95%CI=0.27-0.84, P=0.016). Furthermore, patients with the IL-17F 7488TT genotype showed a severe thrombocytopenic state (platelet count<10 10(9) /L) at diagnosis than those with the IL-17F 7488TC genotype (20.9% vs. 0%, P=0.04). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the IL-17F 7488 T allele is significantly associated with the development of chronic ITP, suggesting a role for IL-17F in the pathogenesis of chronic ITP.

21937424|t|The TREX1 exonuclease R114H mutation in Aicardi-Gouti  res syndrome and lupus reveals dimeric structure requirements for DNA degradation activity.
21937424|a|Mutations in the TREX1 gene cause Aicardi-Gouti  res syndrome (AGS) and are linked to the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. The TREX1 protein is a dimeric 3' DNA exonuclease that degrades DNA to prevent inappropriate immune activation. One of the most common TREX1 mutations, R114H, causes AGS as a homozygous and compound heterozygous mutation and is found as a heterozygous mutation in systemic lupus erythematosus. The TREX1 proteins containing R114H and the insertion mutations aspartate at position 201 (D201ins) and alanine at position 124 (A124ins), found in compound heterozygous AGS with R114H, were prepared and the DNA degradation activities were tested. The homodimer TREX1(R114H/R114H) exhibits a 23-fold reduced single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) exonuclease activity relative to TREX1(WT). The TREX1(D201ins/D201ins) and TREX1(A124ins/A124ins) exhibit more than 10,000-fold reduced ssDNA degradation activities. However, the TREX1(R114H/D201ins) and TREX1(R114H/A124ins) compound heterodimers exhibit activities 10-fold greater than the TREX1(R114H/R114H) homodimer during ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) degradation. These higher levels of activities measured in the TREX1(R114H/D201ins) and TREX1(R114H/A124ins) compound heterodimers are attributed to Arg-114 residues of TREX1(D201ins) and TREX1(A124ins) positioned at the dimer interface contributing to the active sites of the opposing TREX1(R114H) protomer. This interpretation is further supported by exonuclease activities measured for TREX1 enzymes containing R114A and R114K mutations. These biochemical data provide direct evidence for TREX1 residues in one protomer contributing to DNA degradation catalyzed in the opposing protomer and help to explain the dimeric TREX1 structure required for full catalytic competency.

22180037|t|Genetic polymorphism of the glutathione-S-transferase P1 gene (GSTP1) and susceptibility to prostate cancer in the Kashmiri population.
22180037|a|Glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is a critical enzyme of the phase II detoxification pathway. One of the common functional polymorphisms of GSTP1 is A > G at nucleotide 313, which results in an amino acid substitution (Ile105Val) at the substrate binding site of GSTP1 and reduces catalytic activity of GSTP1. To investigate the GSTP1 Ile105Val genotype frequency in prostate cancer cases in the Kashmiri population, we designed a case-control study, in which 50 prostate cancer cases and 45 benign prostate hyperplasia cases were studied for GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism, compared to 80 controls taken from the general population, employing the PCR-RFLP technique. We found the frequency of the three different genotypes of GSTP1 Ile105Val in our ethnic Kashmir population, i.e., Ile/Ile, Ile/Val and Val/Val, to be 52.4, 33.3 and 14.3% among prostate cancer cases, 48.5, 37.5 and 14% among benign prostate hyperplasia cases and 73.8, 21.3 and 5% in the control population, respectively. There was a significant association between the GSTP1 Ile/Val genotype and the advanced age group among the cases. We conclude that GSTP1 Ile/Val polymorphism is involved in the risk of prostate cancer development in our population.

22125978|t|Identification of LIPH gene mutation in a consanguineous family segregating the woolly hair/hypotrichosis phenotype.
22125978|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the disease causing gene in a four generation consanguineous family in which eleven family members were suffering from Woolly hair/hypotrichosis phenotype. METHODS: Linkage analysis was carried out to identify the disease-causing gene in this family. Genomic DNA of all the available family members was genotyped for the microsatellite markers for all the known woolly hair/hypotrichosis loci.Automated DNA sequencing of the candidate gene was performed to identify the disease-causing mutation. RESULTS: By using homozygosity linkage analysis we have mapped the family on chromosome 3q27.3 with a two point LOD score of 4.04, Mutation screening of the LIPH gene revealed a homozygous c.659_660delTA deletion mutation segregating with the disease phenotype. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the c.659_660delTA mutation in the LIPH gene cause autosomal recessive WH/hypotrichosis phenotype in this family. This mutation has been reported in several Pakistani and Guyanese families suggesting a founder mutation in the LIPH gene in Indo-Pak sub-continent.

21042587|t|Familial glucocorticoid receptor haploinsufficiency by non-sense mediated mRNA decay, adrenal hyperplasia and apparent mineralocorticoid excess.
21042587|a|Primary glucocorticoid resistance (OMIM 138040) is a rare hereditary disease that causes a generalized partial insensitivity to glucocorticoid action, due to genetic alterations of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Investigation of adrenal incidentalomas led to the discovery of a family (eight affected individuals spanning three generations), prone to cortisol resistance, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, arterial hypertension and hypokalemia. This phenotype exacerbated over time, cosegregates with the first heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] reported to date for the GR, replacing an arginine (CGA) by a stop (TGA) at amino-acid 469 in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. In vitro, this mutation leads to a truncated 50-kDa GR lacking hormone and DNA binding capacity, devoid of hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and transactivation properties. In the proband's fibroblasts, we provided evidence for the lack of expression of the defective allele in vivo. The absence of detectable mutated GR mRNA was accompanied by a 50% reduction in wild type GR transcript and protein. This reduced GR expression leads to a significantly below-normal induction of glucocorticoid-induced target genes, FKBP5 in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signaling dysfunction involved GR haploinsufficiency due to the selective degradation of the mutated GR transcript through a nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay that was experimentally validated on emetine-treated propositus' fibroblasts. GR haploinsufficiency leads to hypertension due to illicit occupation of renal mineralocorticoid receptor by elevated cortisol rather than to increased mineralocorticoid production reported in primary glucocorticoid resistance. Indeed, apparent mineralocorticoid excess was demonstrated by a decrease in urinary tetrahydrocortisone-tetrahydrocortisol ratio in affected patients, revealing reduced glucocorticoid degradation by renal activity of the 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, a GR regulated gene. We propose thus that GR haploinsufficiency compromises glucocorticoid sensitivity and may represent a novel genetic cause of subclinical hypercortisolism, incidentally revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and mineralocorticoid-independent hypertension.

21182502|t|A novel homozygous splice site mutation in COL7A1 in a Chinese patient with severe recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and squamous cell carcinoma.
21182502|a|BACKGROUND: Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an inherited blistering skin disorder caused by mutations in COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils in the dermo-epidermal junction. The development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most serious complications of this disease. We report herein a Chinese patient with the severe generalized subtype of RDEB (RDEB-sev gen) complicated by SCC. METHODS: Skin biopsies were examined for histology, basement membrane ultrastructure, and type VII collagen expression. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples and subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct automated DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the patient's skin revealed an undetectable expression of type VII collagen polypeptides in the basement membrane zone. Mutation analysis identified a novel splice site mutation in intron 64 (IVS64+5g->a) of COL7A1 gene, which resulted in an in-frame deletion of exon 64 in both alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This report contributes to the expanding database of COL7A1 mutations and emphasizes the need to elucidate the underlying genetic mechanisms associated with the increased incidence of SCC in RDEB patients.

20583543|t|Molecular diagnosis of 46,XY DSD and identification of a novel 8 nucleotide deletion in exon 1 of the SRD5A2 gene.
20583543|a|Phenotypic presentation of 46,XY DSD depends on the underlying defects. Defect in androgen action on the target tissues or production of active metabolite share common morphological features. Molecular study may help differentiating these abnormalities with precision. Mutational analysis of androgen receptor (AR) and SRD5A2 genes was performed in 29 patients with 46,XY DSD, by PCR-SSCP. The amplicons that showed an aberrant migration in SSCP were subjected to sequencing. Interestingly, six patients from 4 unrelated families (a pair of sibs, uncle/nephew and other two isolated) were identified with mutations in SRD5A2 gene. In five patients p.R246Q missense mutation was detected, of which four were homozygous and one was compound heterozygous: g.80_87delT CGCGAAG (p.A27fsX132) and p.R246Q. Another patient with isolated micropenis harbored a heterozygous p.G196S missense mutation. No AR gene mutation was detected. In conclusion, our study suggests that p.R246Q mutation is common amongst patients with SRD5A2 gene defect from the Northern states of India. Also, it records a novel deletion in exon 1 of SRD5A2 gene in a patient with severe hypospadias.

21219851|t|A novel mutation screening system for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, vascular type by high-resolution melting curve analysis in combination with small amplicon genotyping using genomic DNA.
21219851|a|Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type (vEDS) (MIM #130050) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) mutations. Most COL3A1 mutations are detected by using total RNA from patient-derived fibroblasts, which requires an invasive skin biopsy. High-resolution melting curve analysis (hrMCA) has recently been developed as a post-PCR mutation scanning method which enables simple, rapid, cost-effective, and highly sensitive mutation screening of large genes. We established a hrMCA method to screen for COL3A1 mutations using genomic DNA. PCR primers pairs for COL3A1 (52 amplicons) were designed to cover all coding regions of the 52 exons, including the splicing sites. We used 15 DNA samples (8 validation samples and 7 samples of clinically suspected vEDS patients) in this study. The eight known COL3A1 mutations in validation samples were all successfully detected by the hrMCA. In addition, we identified five novel COL3A1 mutations, including one deletion (c.2187delA) and one nonsense mutation (c.2992C>T) that could not be determined by the conventional total RNA method. Furthermore, we established a small amplicon genotyping (SAG) method for detecting three high frequency coding-region SNPs (rs1800255:G>A, rs1801184:T>C, and rs2271683:A>G) in COL3A1 to differentiate mutations before sequencing. The use of hrMCA in combination with SAG from genomic DNA enables rapid detection of COL3A1 mutations with high efficiency and specificity. A better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in COL3A1 using this method will lead to improve in diagnosis and treatment.

20579626|t|Identification of a frameshift mutation in Osterix in a patient with recessive osteogenesis imperfecta.
20579626|a|Osteogenesis imperfecta, or "brittle bone disease," is a type I collagen-related condition associated with osteoporosis and increased risk of bone fractures. Using a combination of homozygosity mapping and candidate gene approach, we have identified a homozygous single base pair deletion (c.1052delA) in SP7/Osterix (OSX) in an Egyptian child with recessive osteogenesis imperfecta. The clinical findings from this patient include recurrent fractures, mild bone deformities, delayed tooth eruption, normal hearing, and white sclera. OSX encodes a transcription factor containing three Cys2-His2 zinc-finger DNA-binding domains at its C terminus, which, in mice, has been shown to be essential for bone formation. The frameshift caused by the c.1052delA deletion removes the last 81 amino acids of the protein, including the third zinc-finger motif. This finding adds another locus to the spectrum of genes associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and reveals that SP7/OSX also plays a key role in human bone development.

21126715|t|A Taiwanese boy with congenital generalized lipodystrophy caused by homozygous Ile262fs mutation in the BSCL2 gene.
21126715|a|Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by a near-complete absence of adipose tissue from birth or early infancy. Mutations in the BSCL2 gene are known to result in CGL2, a more severe phenotype than CGL1, with earlier onset, more extensive fat loss and biochemical changes, more severe intellectual impairment, and more severe cardiomyopathy. We report a 3-month-old Taiwanese boy with initial presentation of a lack of subcutaneous fat, prominent musculature, generalized eruptive xanthomas, and extreme hypertriglyceridemia. Absence of mechanical adipose tissue in the orbits and scalp was revealed by head magnetic resonance imaging. Hepatomegaly was noticed, and histological examination of a liver biopsy specimen suggested severe hepatic steatosis and periportal necrosis. However, echocardiography indicated no sign of cardiomyopathy and he showed no distinct intellectual impairment that interfered with daily life. About 1 year later, abdominal computed tomography revealed enlargement of kidneys. He had a homozygous insertion of a nucleotide, 783insG (Ile262fs mutation), in exon 7 of the BSCL2 gene. We reviewed the genotype of CGL cases from Japan, India, China and Taiwan, and found that BSCL2 is a major causative gene for CGL in Asian.

21130517|t|Detection of EGFR mutations in plasma DNA from lung cancer patients by mass spectrometry genotyping is predictive of tumor EGFR status and response to EGFR inhibitors.
21130517|a|AIMS: EGFR mutations now guide the clinical use of EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancer. However, standard EGFR mutation analysis requires a minimum amount of tumor tissue, which may not be available in certain situations. In this study, we combined a mass spectrometry genotyping assay (Sequenom) with a mutant-enriched PCR (ME-PCR) to detect EGFR mutations in free plasma DNA from patients with lung cancer. METHOD: DNAs were extracted from 31 plasma samples from 31 patients and analyzed by both methods for EGFR Exon 19 deletion and EGFR L858R mutation. Results in plasma DNA samples were compared with EGFR mutation status obtained in tumor DNA (18/31 EGFR mutant). The relationship of EGFR mutation status in tumor and/or plasma samples to overall survival was assessed. RESULTS: The EGFR mutation status in plasma DNA was identical to the primary tumor in 61% of patients (19/31). By mass spectrometry genotyping, the plasma samples contained mutant DNA corresponding to 5/14 EGFR Exon 19 deletions and 3/4 EGFR L858R mutations previously diagnosed in the matched tumors. Two samples were positive in plasma DNA but negative in primary tumor tissue. Results were similar for samples studied by ME-PCR. For patients treated with erlotinib, overall survival was correlated with the presence of EGFR mutation in plasma and/or tumor tissue (p=0.002), with the two patients positive only in plasma DNA showing responses and favorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: The detection of EGFR mutations in plasma DNA samples by mass spectrometry genotyping and ME-PCR is feasible. A positive EGFR result in plasma DNA has a high predictive value for tumor EGFR status and for favorable clinical course on EGFR-targeted therapy and could therefore be useful in guiding clinical decisions in patients with insufficient or unavailable tumor specimens.

21340161|a|The aim of this study was to identify the genetic defect of a patient with dyshormonogenetic congenital hypothyroidisms (CH) with total iodide organification defect (TIOD). A male child diagnosed with CH during neonatal screening. Laboratory tests confirmed the permanent and severe CH with TIOD (99% perchlorate release). The coding sequence of TPO, DUOX2, and DUOXA2 genes and 2957 base pairs (bp) of the TPO promoter were sequenced. Molecular analysis of patient's DNA identified the heterozygous duplication GGCC (c.1186_1187insGGCC) in exon 8 of the TPO gene. No additional mutation was detected either in the TPO gene, TPO promoter, DUOX2 or DUOXA2 genes. We have described a patient with a clear TIOD causing severe goitrous CH due to a monoallelic TPO mutation. A plausible explanation for the association between an autosomal recessive disorder with a single TPO-mutated allele is the presence of monoallelic TPO expression.

21163864|t|The M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene in South Indian patients of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
21163864|a|INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disorder and genetically transmitted cardiac disease with a diverse clinical course. The objective of the present study was to examine the association of the T704C polymorphism of exon 2 of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene with HCM in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. Subjects and methods. One-hundred and fifty HCM (90 sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [SHCM] and 60 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [FHCM]) patients and 165 age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls without known hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were included in the study. DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes and the region of interest in the AGT gene bearing a missense mutation methionine to threonine substitution at codon 235 (M235T) of exon 2, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were subjected to restriction digestion with the enzyme SfaNI. RESULTS: Significant differences were detected in genotypic distribution (p = 0.04) as well as the allelic frequency (p = 0.003) between the SHCM patients and controls. The polymorphism did not show any association with FHCM. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the T allele of the AGT gene is significantly associated with SHCM in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. However, we did not find significant association of this polymorphism with FHCM.

20606392|t|Atypical GH insensitivity syndrome and severe insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency resulting from compound heterozygous mutations of the GH receptor, including a novel frameshift mutation affecting the intracellular domain.
20606392|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: GH insensitivity and IGF deficiency may result from aberrations of the GH receptor (GHR). We describe a 4-year-old child with modest growth failure and normal serum concentrations of GH-binding protein (GHBP), but clinical evidence of GH insensitivity. METHOD: Serum and DNA samples from the proband and his parents were analyzed. RESULTS: The child had a height of -4 SD, elevated serum GH concentrations, abnormally low serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations and normal GHBP concentrations. DNA analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for mutations of GHR, including a previously reported R211H mutation and a novel duplication of a nucleotide in exon 9 (899dupC), the latter resulting in a frameshift and a premature stop codon. Treatment with recombinant DNA-derived IGF-I resulted in growth acceleration. CONCLUSION: Mutations affecting the intracellular domain of the GHR can result in GH insensitivity and IGF deficiency, despite normal serum concentrations of GHBP. The presence of clinical and biochemical evidence of GH resistance is sufficient to consider the possibility of aberrations of the GHR, even in the presence of normal serum GHBP concentrations.

21406173|t|Alteration in the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 6 (PTPN6/SHP1) may contribute to neutrophilic dermatoses.
21406173|a|We have found a B2 repeat insertion in the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 6 (PTPN6) in a mouse that developed a skin disorder with clinical and histopathological features resembling those seen in human neutrophilic dermatoses. Neutrophilic dermatoses are a group of complex heterogeneous autoinflammatory diseases that all demonstrate excessive neutrophil infiltration of the skin. Therefore, we tested the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences of PTPN6 from patients with Sweet's syndrome (SW) and pyoderma gangrenosum and found numerous novel splice variants in different combinations. Isoforms resulting from deletions of exons 2, 5, 11, and 15 and retention of intron 1 or 5 were the most common in a patients with a familial case of SW, who had a neonatal onset of an inflammatory disorder with skin lesions and a biopsy specimen consistent with SW. These isoforms were associated with a heterozygous E441G mutation and a heterozygous 1.7-kbp deletion in the promoter region of the PTPN6 gene. Although full-length PTPN6 was detected in all other patients with either pyoderma gangrenosum or SW, it was always associated with splice variants: a partial deletion of exon 4 with the complete deletion of exon 5, alterations that were not detected in healthy controls. The defect in transcriptional regulation of the hematopoietic PTPN6 appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of certain subsets of the heterogeneous group of neutrophilic dermatoses.

20577006|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in TRPV4, a gene that encodes a Ca(2+) permeable non-selective cation channel, have recently been found in a spectrum of skeletal dysplasias that includes brachyolmia, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type (SMDK) and metatropic dysplasia (MD). Only a total of seven missense mutations were detected, however. The full spectrum of TRPV4 mutations and their phenotypes remained unclear. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To examine TRPV4 mutation spectrum and phenotype-genotype association, we searched for TRPV4 mutations by PCR-direct sequencing from genomic DNA in 22 MD and 20 SMDK probands. RESULTS: TRPV4 mutations were found in all but one MD subject. In total, 19 different heterozygous mutations were identified in 41 subjects; two were recurrent and 17 were novel. In MD, a recurrent P799L mutation was identified in nine subjects, as well as 10 novel mutations including F471del, the first deletion mutation of TRPV4. In SMDK, a recurrent R594H mutation was identified in 12 subjects and seven novel mutations. An association between the position of mutations and the disease phenotype was also observed. Thus, P799 in exon 15 is a hot codon for MD mutations, as four different amino acid substitutions have been observed at this codon; while R594 in exon 11 is a hotspot for SMDK mutations. CONCLUSION: The TRPV4 mutation spectrum in MD and SMDK, which showed genotype-phenotype correlation and potential functional significance of mutations that are non-randomly distributed over the gene, was presented in this study. The results would help diagnostic laboratories establish efficient screening strategies for genetic diagnosis of the TRPV4 dysplasia family diseases.

20534142|t|Association of obesity risk SNPs in PCSK1 with insulin sensitivity and proinsulin conversion.
20534142|a|BACKGROUND: Prohormone convertase 1 is involved in maturation of peptides. Rare mutations in gene PCSK1, encoding this enzyme, cause childhood obesity and abnormal glucose homeostasis with elevated proinsulin concentrations. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene, rs6232 and rs6235, are associated with obesity. We studied whether these SNPs influence the prediabetic traits insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, or glucose intolerance. METHODS: We genotyped 1498 German subjects for SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 within PCSK1. The subjects were metabolically characterized by oral glucose tolerance test with glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide measurements. A subgroup of 512 subjects underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies were 25.8% for SNP rs6235 and 6.0% for rs6232. After adjustment for sex and age, we found no association of SNPs rs6235 and rs6232 with BMI or other weight-related traits (all p >or= 0.07). Both minor alleles, adjusted for sex, age, BMI and insulin sensitivity were associated with elevated AUCproinsulin and AUCproinsulin/AUCinsulin (rs6235: p(additive) model <or= 0.009, effect sizes 8/8%, rs6232: pdominant model <or= 0.01, effect sizes 10/21%). Insulin secretion was not affected by the variants (different secretion parameters, all p >or= 0.08). The minor allele of SNP rs6232 was additionally associated with 15% higher OGTT-derived and 19% higher clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (pdom <or= 0.0047), 4.5% lower HOMAIR (pdom = 0.02) and 3.5% lower 120-min glucose (pdom = 0.0003) independently of BMI and proinsulin conversion. SNP rs6235 was not associated with parameters of glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Like rare mutations in PCSK1, the more common variants tested determine glucose-stimulated proinsulin conversion, but not insulin secretion. In addition, rs6232, encoding the amino acid exchange N221D, influences insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.

20227423|t|A functional polymorphism in the disrupted-in schizophrenia 1 gene is associated with chronic fatigue syndrome.
20227423|a|AIMS: Disrupted-in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), identified in a pedigree with a familial psychosis with the chromosome translocation (1:11), is a putative susceptibility gene for psychoses such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) report having continuous severe fatigue and many overlapping symptoms with MDD; however, the mechanism and effective treatment of CFS are still unclear. We focused on the overlapping symptoms between CFS and MDD and performed an association study of the functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DISC1 gene with CFS. MAIN METHODS: Venous blood was drawn from CFS patients and controls and genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood according to standard procedures. Ser704Cys DISC1 SNP was genotyped using the TaqMan 5'-exonuclease allelic discrimination assay. KEY FINDINGS: We found that the Cys704 allele of Ser704Cys SNP was associated with an increased risk of CFS development compared with the Ser704 allele. SIGNIFICANCE: DISC1 Ser704Cys might be a functional variant that affects one of the mechanisms implicated in the biology of CFS. Some patients with CFS showed a phenotype similar to that of patients with MDD, but further studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanism, because this study is of a rather preliminary nature. Despite the variety of patients with CFS, DISC1 Ser704Cys has an association with CFS, which may also suggest that DISC1 plays a central role in the induction of various psychiatric diseases.

20143913|t|Large deletion involving exon 5 of the arylsulfatase B gene caused apparent homozygosity in a mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patient.
20143913|a|Apparent homozygosity for the mutation p.R315X present on exon 5 of the arylsulfatase B (ARSB) gene in a mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patient was solved in this study by further testing for a second mutation. Patient cDNA analysis revealed that the entire exon 5 of the ARSB gene was lacking; this new mutation was identified as c.899-1142del. As the genomic DNA sequencing excluded the presence of splicing mutations, polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed for polymorphisms listed in the NCBI SNP database for the ARSB gene. This allowed the mutation at the genomic DNA level to be identified as g.99367-102002del; this gross deletion, involving the entire exon 5 of the gene and parts of introns 4 and 5 led to a frameshift starting at amino acid 300 and resulting in a protein with 39% amino acids different from the normal enzyme. We stress that extensive DNA analysis needs to be performed in case of apparent homozygosity to avoid potential errors in genetic counseling.

20086182|t|The six-nucleotide deletion/insertion variant in the CASP8 promoter region is inversely associated with risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
20086182|a|Caspase 8 (CASP8) is an apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase involved in the death receptor pathway and likely in the mitochondrial pathway. A CASP8 promoter region six-nucleotide deletion/insertion (-652 6N ins/del) variant and a coding region D302H polymorphism are reportedly important in cancer development, but no reported study has assessed the associations of these genetic variations with risk of head and neck cancer. In a hospital-based study of non-Hispanic whites, we genotyped CASP8 -652 6N del and 302H variants in 1,023 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and 1,052 cancer-free controls. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. The CASP8 -652 6N del variant genotypes or haplotypes were inversely associated with SCCHN risk (adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85 for the ins/del + del/del genotypes compared with the ins/ins genotype; adjusted OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97 for the del-D haplotype compared with the ins-D haplotype). Furthermore, the number of the CASP8 -652 6N del (but not 302H) variant allele tended to correlate with increased levels of camptothecin-induced p53-mediated apoptosis in T lymphocytes from 170 cancer-free controls. We concluded that the CASP8 -652 6N del variant allele may contribute to the risk of developing SCCHN in non-Hispanic white populations. Further validation by population-based case-control studies and rigorous mechanistic studies is warranted.

20026870|t|Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion and angiotensin type 1 receptor A1166C polymorphisms as genetic risk factors in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.
20026870|a|INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasias in developed countries. In 2003, 6,536 new cases and 4,602 related deaths were reported in Mexico. The renin-angiotensin system has been shown to play a role in prostate cancer pathology. Two previous studies investigated the association of prostate cancer with the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene; both studies reported an association between prostate cancer and the DD genotype. The present study was aimed at searching for an association of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia with the I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene and the A1166C polymorphism in the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AGT1R) gene and at comparing allele frequencies between both groups and the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from 20 samples from individuals with a prostate cancer diagnosis and from 20 samples from individuals with a benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis. Polymorphism frequency results obtained for the test groups were compared with the frequencies in 66 individuals from the general population, which were previously obtained at the same molecular medicine laboratory in the context of other studies. RESULTS: The comparative analysis of the three groups revealed significant differences for allele frequencies in the two genes in patients groups (prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia) versus the general population. The D allele in the ACE gene was closely associated with a significant higher risk of developing both benign prostatic hyperplasia (odds ratio [OR]=21.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.314-206.479) or prostate cancer (OR=31.66; 95% CI=0.091-1.272), and the AGT1R A1166 allele in the homozygote state was identified as a risk genotype for benign prostatic hyperplasia (OR=56.07). CONCLUSIONS: Genotypes in ACE and AGT1R polymorphisms could be considered as genetic risk markers for benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer.

19958188|t|Molecular analysis of gamma-globin promoters, HS-111 and 3'HS1, in beta-thalassemia intermedia patients associated with high levels of Hb F.
19958188|a|The nucleotide (nt) variations in the promoter region of the gamma-globin genes, HS-111 and 3'HS1 regions, were studied in Iranian patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia (beta-TI), beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) and healthy individuals. Of the five nt variations at the 5' end of the (A)gamma-globin gene, -369 (C>G), -611 (-T) and -603/604 (GA>AG) were found in all samples, whereas -588 (A>G) and -AAGC at -222 to -225 were found at different frequencies in the studied groups. Therefore, the -369, -611 and -603/604 variations were considered common mutations in this population, and the difference with respect to the -AAGC deletion was not significant. However, the A allele of the -588 variation and [+] allele of the XmnI polymorphism were more frequent in beta-TI patients, especially those who had the IVS-II-1(G>A)/IVS-II-1(G>A) genotype. The + allele of XmnI also had complete correlation with the A allele of -588 variation. The HS-111 (-21 A) variation also showed association with beta-TI patients who had high levels of Hb F. Bearing in mind that the -588 variation lies within the postulated adult-specific silencer region and that the majority of beta-TI patients had allele A, then it can be envisaged that this allele could have a role in altering the repressor function at this region. Therefore, the A allele of -588, [+] allele of XmnI and HS-111 (-21 A) variation are useful genetic markers to differentiate between beta-TM and beta-TI patients. However, these nt changes alone may not be the only elements raising the level of Hb F, other regulatory and modifying factors also play a role in Hb F production.

19929939|t|Multiple trichoepitheliomas--a novel mutation in the CYLD gene.
19929939|a|BACKGROUND: Trichoepitheliomas are benign neoplasms with follicular differentiation. They may present as a solitary lesion or as multiple lesions. Multiple trichoepitheliomas are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern within families, with both variable penetrance and expressivity. Recent investigations support that mutations in CYLD, the gene affected in familial cylindromatosis as well as in Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, are also responsible for multiple trichoepitheliomas. OBJECTIVE: The authors report the case of a 9-year-old African girl with multiple facial trichoepitheliomas in whom a mutation in the CYLD gene was hypothesised. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After genomic DNA extraction from the peripheral blood, a molecular analysis of the CYLD gene was performed by PCR, DHPLC and automated sequencing. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous mutation in exon 18 of the CYLD gene (c.2449delT) was identified, with a deletion of one nucleotide resulting in a premature translational termination codon at amino acid position 831 on the affected allele (p.Cys817Valfs X15). CONCLUSIONS: The predominating tumours define the classification of these three entities. Nevertheless, studies suggest that they can simply represent phenotypic variations of the same disease spectrum, sharing common genetic mutations.

19918264|t|FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism and prostate cancer risk in Scottish men.
19918264|a|Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), a member of the fibroblast growth receptor family, was recently reported to be more abundantly expressed in malignant than benign prostate cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism at position 388 of the FGFR4 amino-acid sequence results in the substitution of glycine (Gly) with arginine (Arg) and higher frequency of the ArgArg genotype was previously found in prostate cancer patients. DNA was extracted from the blood drawn from 399 prostate cancer patients, 150 BPH patients and 294 healthy community controls. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out and single nucleotide polymorphisms of FGFR4 were identified by restriction enzyme digestion. No overall association is detectable between the Arg allele and increased prostate cancer risk. Subgroup analysis shows a higher incidence of the heterozygous ArgGly genotype in cancer cases than in the combined group of BPH and controls (P<0.05); this difference is statistically significant between cancer and BPH patients but not between cancer cases and community controls. The single nucleotide polymorphism Gly(388)Arg in FGFR4 is not associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in Scottish men. This observation is in contrast with results from two previous studies conducted in the USA and Japan.

19880293|t|Polymorphisms in the FOXP3 gene in Han Chinese psoriasis patients.
19880293|a|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common dermatological disorder, in which autoimmunity plays an important role. CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (T-regs) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases. T-regs express the fork head/winged helix transcription factor, FOXP3, which appears to be of key importance in the development and function of T-regs. Studies have found that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FOXP3 gene contribute to susceptibility to some autoimmune disorders. However, information about FOXP3 gene in psoriasis is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the association between FOXP3 gene SNPs and susceptibility to psoriasis in a Han Chinese population. METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study, 524 patients with psoriasis and 549 psoriasis-free controls were recruited according to age and gender. We investigated four SNPs in the FOXP3 gene (-6054, deletion/ATT; -3279, A/C; -924, A/G; IVS9+459, A/G) in psoriatic patients, and assessed allele and genotype frequencies in psoriatic patients (237 females, 287 males) and normal controls (272 females, 277 males). The polymorphisms were genotyped using the PCR sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: We found that increased risk of psoriasis was associated with the FOXP3 -3279 AC genotype (adjusted OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.74) and the combined AC+AA genotype (adjusted OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.78), compared with the -3279 CC genotype. We also found that an increased risk of psoriasis was associated with the FOXP3 IVS9+459 GG genotype (adjusted OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.41-3.58). However, the combined GA+GG genotype showed no such tendency (adjusted OR=1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), compared with the IVS9+459 AA genotype. There was no evidence of an increased risk associated with the FOXP3-6054 deletion/ATT or FOXP3-924 A/G genotype. In combined genotype analyses, the FOXP3-3279 AC+AA genotype was more obviously associated in males (adjusted OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.11-2.31) and severe psoriasis patients (PASI score >20; adjusted OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.41-2.75). Meanwhile, the FOXP3 IVS9+459 GA+GG genotype was also associated with severe psoriasis patients (adjusted OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.21-2.36). CONCLUSIONS: FOXP3 polymorphisms appear to contribute to the risk of psoriasis in a Han Chinese population. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

19728872|t|A MANBA mutation resulting in residual beta-mannosidase activity associated with severe leukoencephalopathy: a possible pseudodeficiency variant.
19728872|a|BACKGROUND: beta-Mannosidosis (OMIM 248510) is a rare inborn lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficient activity of beta-mannosidase, an enzyme encoded by a single gene (MANBA) located on chromosome 4q22-25. To date, only 20 cases of this autosomal recessive disorder have been described and 14 different MANBA mutations were incriminated in the disease. These are all null mutations or missense mutations that abolish beta-mannosidase activity. In this study, we characterized the molecular defect of a new case of beta-mannosidosis, presenting with a severe neurological disorder. METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient to allow MANBA sequencing. The identified mutation was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutant protein was expressed through transient transfection in HEK293T cells. The beta-mannosidase expression and activity were respectively assessed by Western blot and fluorometric assay in both leukocytes and HEK293T cells. RESULTS: A missense disease-associated mutation, c.1922G>A (p.Arg641His), was identified for which the patient was homozygous. In contrast to previously described missense mutations, this substitution does not totally abrogate the enzyme activity but led to a residual activity of about 7% in the patient's leukocytes, 11% in lymphoblasts and 14% in plasma. Expression studies in transfected cells also resulted in 7% residual activity. CONCLUSION: Correlations between MANBA mutations, residual activity of beta-mannosidase and the severity of the ensuing neurological disorder are discussed. Whether the c.1922G>A mutation is responsible for a yet undescribed pseudodeficiency of beta-mannosidase is also discussed.

19664890|t|Screening of the LIX1 gene in Japanese and Malaysian patients with SMA and/or SMA-like disorder.
19664890|a|BACKGROUND: The majority of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients showed homozygous deletion or other mutations of SMN1. However, the genetic etiology of a significant number of SMA patients has not been clarified. Recently, mutation in the gene underlying cat SMA, limb expression 1 (LIX1), has been reported. Similarity in clinical and pathological features of cat and human SMA may give an insight into possible similarity of the genetic etiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we screened for a mutation in LIX1 using direct DNA sequencing in our SMA and/or SMA-like patients who retained SMN1. A total of 33 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 22 were Japanese and 11 were Malaysians. All these patients possessed at least two copies of SMN1. RESULTS: We did not identify any pathogenic mutations in the coding regions or splice sites of LIX1 in the patients. In addition, we described a polymorphism within LIX1 intron 3, c.387+107A>T. We found that A-allele is significantly more frequent in SMA patients compared to normal individuals. CONCLUSION: Molecular genetic analysis of our SMA and/or SMA-like patients suggests that LIX1 is not associated with the development of their disorders. However, the number of patients analyzed in this study was very limited, and a larger study with bigger sample size is needed to confirm this result.

19592582|t|Matriptase-2 mutations in iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia patients provide new insights into protease activation mechanisms.
19592582|a|Mutations leading to abrogation of matriptase-2 proteolytic activity in humans are associated with an iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) due to elevated hepcidin levels. Here we describe two novel heterozygous mutations within the matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6) gene of monozygotic twin girls exhibiting an IRIDA phenotype. The first is the frameshift mutation (P686fs) caused by the insertion of the four nucleotides CCCC in exon 16 (2172_2173insCCCC) that is predicted to terminate translation before the catalytic serine. The second mutation is the di-nucleotide substitution c.467C>A and c.468C>T in exon 3 that causes the missense mutation A118D in the SEA domain of the extracellular stem region of matriptase-2. Functional analysis of both variant matriptase-2 proteases has revealed that they lead to ineffective suppression of hepcidin transcription. We also demonstrate that the A118D SEA domain mutation causes an intra-molecular structural imbalance that impairs matriptase-2 activation. Collectively, these results extend the pattern of TMPRSS6 mutations associated with IRIDA and functionally demonstrate that mutations affecting protease regions other than the catalytic domain may have a profound impact in the regulatory role of matriptase-2 during iron deficiency.

19521089|t|Serotonin transporter gene polymorphic element 5-HTTLPR increases the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease in Italy.
19521089|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder causing muscular rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia. We conducted an association study assessing how PD risk in Italy was influenced by the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) polymorphic region 5-HTTLPR, consisting of an insertion/deletion (long allele-L/short allele-S) of 43 bp in the SLC6A4 promoter region. The SLC6A4 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531(A-->G) was evaluated too. We collected 837 independent subjects (393 PD, 444 controls). An association between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and risk of PD (S/S genotype OR [95% CI]: 1.7[1.2-2.5], p = 0.002) was found. The rs25531 and the haplotype 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 did not associate with risk of PD. Our data indicate that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphic element within the SLC6A4 promoter may govern the genetic risk of PD in Italians.

19476483|t|The role of the CCR5 Delta32 polymorphism in abdominal aortic aneurysms.
19476483|a|BACKGROUND: C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) may arise as the result of a chronic inflammatory process which is influenced by genetic predisposition. The CCR5 gene is associated with a 32 base pair deletion (the Delta32 polymorphism). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the CCR5 Delta32 polymorphism in the development of AAA. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted including 285 patients with AAA and 273 control subjects. A blood sample was taken from each individual and DNA was extracted. CCR5 genotype was determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Flow cytometry was used to investigate the biological activity of the Delta32 polymorphism. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the AAA and the control group in relation to the Delta32 allele frequency (AAA group 10%, control group = 12%, P = 0.82, chi-squared analysis). Genotype analysis revealed no significant difference between the groups (AAA vs. controls, wild-type homozygotes = 82% vs. 77%, heterozygotes = 16% vs. 21%, vs. Delta32 homozygotes = 2% and 2%, respectively, P = 0.33, chi-squared analysis). The polymorphism was shown to be biologically active with the number of Delta32 alleles correlating with cell expression of ccr5 as detected with flow cytometry (P < or = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the ccr5 Delta32 is a biologically active genetic polymorphism; however, there is no association between this polymorphism and AAA.

19448408|t|Correlation of polymorphism of the coding region of glutathione S- transferase M1 to susceptibility of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in South China population.
19448408|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) deficiency may increase the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study was to evaluate the correlation of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding region of GSTM1 gene to NPC susceptibility in southern China population. METHODS: In total 239 NPC patients and 286 age-matched healthy controls were entered into the study. Among them, 225 out of 239 NPC patients and 273 out of 286 controls were used for statistical analysis. SNP screening of all exons, relevant intron-exon boundaries, and the promoter region of GSTM1, in total 4739bp, was performed by PCR direct sequencing. The loci T1270533G and C1256088C were selected for the case-control study using the tetra-Primer ARMS-PCR, as well as the sequencing method. RESULTS: In total 29 SNPs of GSTM1 were identified by sequencing. Missense mutation occurred in the polymorphic loci of T1270533G and C1256088C. However, no evident relationships between the variants of T1270533G and clinical phenotypes of NPC were observed in the NPC group and healthy control group (OR = 0.170, 95%CI = 0.95-0.306 for homozygote TT). The deletion frequency of C1256088C was 45% (45/100) for NPC patients and 42% (42/100) for controls. CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism of T1270533G does not affect the detoxification function of GSTM1. The T1270533G locus has no apparent association with genetic susceptibility to NPC in the southern China population. The loss rate of C1256088C is high in this study.

19404517|t|A large Swiss family with Bernard-Soulier syndrome - Correlation phenotype and genotype.
19404517|a|Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopathy and giant platelets. BSS is caused by genetic alterations of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib/V/IX complex. We report on a large Swiss family of whom four family members suffer from BSS. Here, a homozygous missense mutation in position 1829 (A(R)G) of the GPIX gene constituting a N45S substitution is the cause for the bleeding symptoms. A total of 38 family members within two generations were analyzed regarding the N45S mutation by DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The laboratory parameters which are characteristically for BSS such as platelet count, platelet volume and the expression of CD42a (GPIX), CD42b (GPIbalpha) and CD41 (GPIIb) were measured for all 38 individuals. The four homozygous patients showed bleeding symptoms, thrombocytopenia and giant platelets. In these patients, the expression of CD42a (GPIX), CD42b (GPIbalpha) was diminished. Interestingly, the intensity of the bleeding symptoms of the 4 homozygous family members seemed to vary although they carry the same mutation. The 24 heterozygous carriers did not differ significantly from their 10 wildtype family members regarding bleeding symptoms and laboratory analysis.

19370764|t|Identification and molecular characterization of six novel mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase gamma subunit (GNPTG) gene in patients with mucolipidosis III gamma.
19370764|a|Mucolipidosis type III (MLIII) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting lysosomal hydrolase trafficking. In a study of 10 patients from seven families with a clinical phenotype and enzymatic diagnosis of MLIII, six novel GNPTG gene mutations were identified. These included missense (p.T286M) and nonsense (p.W111X) mutations and a transition in the obligate AG-dinucleotide of the intron 8 acceptor splice site (c.610-2A>G). Three microdeletions were also identified, two of which (c.611delG and c.640_667del28) were located within the coding region whereas one (c.609+28_610-16del) was located entirely within intron 8. RT-PCR analysis of the c.610-2A>G transition demonstrated that the change altered splicing, leading to the production of two distinct aberrantly spliced forms, viz. the skipping of exon 9 (p.G204_K247del) or the retention of introns 8 and 9 (p.G204VfsX28). RT-PCR analysis, performed on a patient homozygous for the intronic deletion (c.609+28_610-16del), failed to detect any GNPTG RNA transcripts. To determine whether c.609+28_610-16del allele-derived transcripts were subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), patient fibroblasts were incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. An RT-PCR fragment retaining 43 bp of intron 8 was consistently detected suggesting that the 33-bp genomic deletion had elicited NMD. Quantitative real-time PCR and GNPTG western blot analysis confirmed that the homozygous microdeletion p.G204VfsX17 had elicited NMD resulting in failure to synthesize GNPTG protein. Analysis of the sequences surrounding the microdeletion breakpoints revealed either intrinsic repetitivity of the deleted region or short direct repeats adjacent to the breakpoint junctions. This is consistent with these repeats having mediated the microdeletions via replication slippage and supports the view that the mutational spectrum of the GNPTG gene is strongly influenced by the properties of the local DNA sequence environment.

19218574|t|Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85alpha regulatory subunit gene Met326Ile polymorphism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
19218574|a|BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is a core feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is an important enzyme in the early insulin signaling cascade and plays a key role in insulin-mediated glucose transport. In its regulatory subunit, p85alpha, there is a common amino acid substitution (the Met326Ile polymorphism), and this amino acid may be crucial for the function of the p85alpha regulatory subunit and PI3-kinase. METHODS: Analysis of the Met326Ile polymorphism was carried out on DNA samples from 256 PCOS patients and 283 controls. Clinical and biochemical profiles of participants were also compared. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the Met326Ile polymorphism in the PCOS group was not different from that of the controls (Met326Met/Met326Ile/Ile326Ile rates were 73.4%/23.4%/3.2% and 70.3%/26.1%/3.6% for the PCOS and control groups, respectively, P = 0.72). The PCOS group was divided into two subgroups according to the presence of the variant 326Ile allele. Compared with those carrying at least one variant 326Ile allele, carriers with the Met326Met genotype had higher serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) {1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.3] ng/ml in those with the Met326Met genotype versus 0.8 (95% CI 0.7-1.0) ng/ml in those with Ile326Ile and Met326Ile genotypes, P = 0.0073} and free testosterone levels [1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.4) pg/ml for Met326Met genotype versus 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.3) pg/ml for Ile326Ile and Met326Ile genotypes, P = 0.038]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the PI3-kinase gene Met326Ile polymorphism may not be a major determinant for the development of PCOS, but it may modulate the concentrations of serum 17-OHP or free testosterone in PCOS patients.

19144556|t|Identification of newly polymorphic intron 40 markers of the von Willebrand factor gene in a Japanese population.
19144556|a|We investigated a region of repetitive DNA located in intron 40 of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene (nucleotides [nt] 1639-2404; i.e., F8VWF). We identified 13 alleles and 33 genotypes in 49 unrelated Japanese individuals. The heterozygosity of the region was 0.897. Direct sequence analyses revealed five single-base substitutions, one tetranucleotide (TTAT) insertion, and seven short tandem repeats (STRs) in the intron; four of the STRs and one single-base substitution had been reported previously. The four new base substitutions we identified were 1849T>A, 2122C>T, 2180C>T, and 2192C>T. The novel TTAT tetranucleotide was inserted between nt 2057 and 2058. The three newly identified STRs were 1978(TATC)(1-2), 2193(ATCT)(5-13), and 2234(TGTA)(5-7). The five single-base substitutions and the TTAT insertion were identified only with 3' downstream of vWA allele 14.

18790087|t|Is the European spatial distribution of the HIV-1-resistant CCR5-Delta32 allele formed by a breakdown of the pathocenosis due to the historical Roman expansion?
18790087|a|We studied the possible effects of the expansion of ancient Mediterranean civilizations during the five centuries before and after Christ on the European distribution of the mutant allele for the chemokine receptor gene CCR5 which has a 32-bp deletion (CCR5-Delta32). There is a strong evidence for the unitary origin of the CCR5-Delta32 mutation, this it is found principally in Europe and Western Asia, with generally a north-south downhill cline frequency. Homozygous carriers of this mutation show a resistance to HIV-1 infection and a slower progression towards AIDS. However, HIV has clearly emerged too recently to have been the selective force on CCR5. Our analyses showed strong negative correlations in Europe between the allele frequency and two historical parameters, i.e. the first colonization dates by the great ancient Mediterranean civilizations, and the distances from the Northern frontiers of the Roman Empire in its greatest expansion. Moreover, other studies have shown that the deletion frequencies in both German Bronze Age and Swedish Neolithic populations were similar to those found in the corresponding modern populations, and this deletion has been found in ancient DNA of around 7000 years ago, suggesting that in the past, the deletion frequency could have been relatively high in European populations. In addition, in West Nile virus pathogenesis, CCR5 plays an antimicrobial role showing that host genetic factors are highly pathogen-specific. Our results added to all these previous data suggest that the actual European allele frequency distribution might not be due to genes spreading, but to a negative selection resulting in the spread of pathogens principally during Roman expansion. Indeed, as gene flows from colonizers to European native populations were extremely low, the mutational changes might be associated with vulnerability to imported infections. To date, the nature of the parasites remains unknown; however, zoonoses could be incriminated.

18681856|t|Expanding clinical spectrum of non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism due to an activating germline mutation, p.M453T, in the thyrotropin receptor gene.
18681856|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and genetic features of a Thai family with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism (NAH) caused by an activating germline mutation in the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene. PATIENTS: Three affected individuals from the same family (a father and his two children) were studied. Clinical and imaging findings were reviewed and compared. GENETIC ANALYSIS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and mutation analysis of the entire coding sequence of the TSHR gene was performed in both children and their parents by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: A heterozygous germline T to C transition in exon 10 of the TSHR gene (c.1358T-->C) resulting in the substitution of methionine (ATG) by threonine (ACG) at codon 453 (p.M453T) was identified in the father and his two children. They presented with different clinical severity and variable age of onset. In addition to hyperthyroidism, ventriculomegaly and bilateral shortening of the fifth metacarpal bones and the middle phalanges of the fifth fingers were consistently found in all affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Ventriculomegaly and bilateral shortening of the fifth metacarpal bones and the middle phalanges of the fifth fingers might be characteristic features of NAH because of an activating TSHR germline mutation. In addition, the shortening of the middle phalanges of the fifth fingers has never been previously described, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of the disease.

19808398|t|Molecular and clinical characterization of a novel SCN5A mutation associated with atrioventricular block and dilated cardiomyopathy.
19808398|a|BACKGROUND: Increased susceptibility to dilated cardiomyopathy has been observed in patients carrying mutations in the SCN5A gene, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized, both in vitro and clinically, an SCN5A mutation associated with familial progressive atrioventricular block of adult onset and dilated cardiomyopathy in a Chinese family. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 32 family members, 5 were initially diagnosed with atrioventricular block after age 30; 4 were studied, 3 of whom later developed dilated cardiomyopathy. We found a heterozygous single-nucleotide mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution (A1180V) in all studied patients and in 6 other younger unaffected members but not in 200 control chromosomes. When expressed with the beta1 subunit, the mutated channels exhibited a -4.5-mV shift of inactivation with slower recovery leading to a rate-dependent Na(+) current reduction and a moderate increase in late Na(+) current. Clinical study revealed that although QRS duration decreased with increasing heart rate in noncarrier family members, this change was blunted in unaffected carriers whose ECG and heart function were normal. Resting corrected QT interval of unaffected carriers was significantly longer than that of noncarriers, even though it was still within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: A1180V expresses a mild Na(+) channel phenotype in vitro and a corresponding clinical phenotype in unaffected mutation carriers, implying that A1180V caused structural heart disease in affected carriers by disturbing Na(+) influx and, hence, cellular Na(+) homeostasis. The high penetrance of A1180V suggests this phenotype as a high risk factor for dilated cardiomyopathy with preceding atrioventricular block.

18470323|t|Anticipation in familial lattice corneal dystrophy type I with R124C mutation in the TGFBI (BIGH3) gene.
18470323|a|PURPOSE: To report the clinical, ophthalmic, and genetic characteristics for lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCDI) in a Chilean family. METHODS: Six affected family members were examined clinically including visual acuity, color cornea photography, applanation tonography, and fundoscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes from six affected and three unaffected members of a family with lattice corneal dystrophy type I. Exon 4 of the transforming growth factor-induced gene (TGFBI) was screened for the most frequent mutation, R124C, in the proband by sequencing. We also designed a rapid polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to analyze the same mutation, amplifying exon 4 and digesting with PstI restriction enzyme. Using this strategy, we analyzed the mutation in six affected and three healthy family members. RESULTS: Three generations of family members were positively diagnosed with lattice corneal dystrophy. Six participants demonstrated LCD1 in both eyes, most of whom were symmetric. Age at onset of symptoms was variable (3-42 years old). Moreover, in this family, the age of onset of the disease decreased in succeeding generations, which could be interpreted as anticipation. Visual acuity varied from 1.0 to 0.13. Two patients, ages 69 and 44 years old, demonstrated a degree of severity "Bad" according to best-corrected vision and corneal commitment. The exon 4 sequence of TGFBI of the proband exhibits the heterozygous single-nucleotide mutation, C417T, leading to amino acid substitution (R124C) in the encoded TGF-induced protein. Using PCR-RFLP, we confirmed the heterozygous mutation in six affected family members and excluded it in three healthy members. CONCLUSIONS: The R124C mutation in TGFBI cosegregated with LCD type I in the investigated family. This is the first report of a molecular analysis of LCD type I in Chilean patients. The early onset affected persons in the fourth generation raises the possibility of anticipation.

18457324|t|Genetic polymorphisms in the carbonyl reductase 3 gene CBR3 and the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene NQO1 in patients who developed anthracycline-related congestive heart failure after childhood cancer.
18457324|a|BACKGROUND: Exposure to anthracyclines as part of cancer therapy has been associated with the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). The potential role of genetic risk factors in anthracycline-related CHF remains to be defined. Thus, in this study, the authors examined whether common polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in the pharmacodynamics of anthracyclines (in particular, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene NQO1 and the carbonyl reductase 3 gene CBR3) had an impact on the risk of anthracycline-related CHF. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted within a cohort of 1979 patients enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who received treatment with anthracyclines and had available DNA. Thirty patients with CHF (cases) and 115 matched controls were genotyped for polymorphisms in NQO1 (NQO1*2) and CBR3 (the CBR3 valine [V] to methionine [M] substitution at position 244 [V244M]). Enzyme activity assays with recombinant CBR3 isoforms (CBR3 V244 and CBR3 M244) and the anthracycline substrate doxorubicin were used to investigate the functional impact of the CBR3 V244M polymorphism. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for sex and primary disease recurrence were used to test for associations between the candidate genetic polymorphisms (NQO1*2 and CBR3 V244M) and the risk of CHF. Analyses indicated no association between the NQO1*2 polymorphism and the risk of anthracycline-related CHF (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; P=.97). There was a trend toward an association between the CBR3 V244M polymorphism and the risk of CHF (OR, 8.16; P=.056 for G/G vs A/A; OR, 5.44; P=.092 for G/A vs A/A). In line, recombinant CBR3 V244 (G allele) synthesized 2.6-fold more cardiotoxic doxorubicinol per unit of time than CBR3 M244 (A allele; CBR3 V244 [8.26+/-3.57 nmol/hour.mg] vs CBR3 M244 [3.22+/-0.67 nmol/hour.mg]; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: The functional CBR3 V244M polymorphism may have an impact on the risk of anthracycline-related CHF among childhood cancer survivors by modulating the intracardiac formation of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites. Larger confirmatory case-control studies are warranted.

18410548|t|Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene mutation analysis in children and adolescents with sporadic pituitary adenomas.
18410548|a|OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas occur rarely in childhood and adolescence. Pituitary adenoma predisposition (PAP) has been recently associated with germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene. The aim of the study was to examine the proportion of germline AIP mutations in apparently sporadic paediatric pituitary adenomas. DESIGN: Genomic DNA was analysed for mutations in the AIP gene, by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PATIENTS: A population-based cohort consisting of 36 apparently sporadic paediatric pituitary adenoma patients, referred to two medical centres in Italy, was included in the study. Patients were either less than 18 years at diagnosis, or showed clinical evidence of adenoma development before the age of 18 years. RESULTS: A heterozygous in-frame deletion Y248del (c.742_744delTAC) was identified in one GH-secreting adenoma patient. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of tumour DNA revealed the loss of the wild-type allele. First degree relatives carrying the mutation were clinically unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: While mutations were absent in non-GH-secreting adenoma patients, germline AIP mutations can be found in children and adolescents with GH-secreting tumours, even in the absence of family history. The present study reports the AIP mutation analysis results on patients of a single ethnic origin. Clearly, further studies are needed to improve our knowledge on the role of AIP in paediatric pituitary adenomas.

18408250|t|A single nucleotide polymorphism in the IRF5 promoter region is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in the Japanese population.
18408250|a|OBJECTIVES: Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors, which regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Polymorphisms in the IRF5 gene have been associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE) in Caucasian and Asian populations, but their involvement in other autoimmune diseases is still uncertain. Here, we assessed the genetic role of IRF5 in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Japanese subjects. METHODS: We selected 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a CGGGG insertion-deletion polymorphism in the IRF5 gene. We performed 2 sets of case-control comparisons using Japanese subjects (first set: 830 patients with RA and 658 controls; second set: 1112 patients with RA and 940 controls), and then performed a stratified analysis using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) status. We genotyped the SNPs using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: A significant association of the rs729302 A allele with RA susceptibility was found in both sets (odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.35, p<0.001 in the combined analysis). When the patients were stratified by the SE, the rs729302 A allele was found to confer increased risk to RA in patients that were SE negative (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92, p = 0.001) as compared with patients carrying the SE (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33, p = 0.24). In both sets, no genotyped polymorphisms were significantly associated with RA susceptibility, but rs729302 was significantly associated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the promoter polymorphism of IRF5 is a genetic factor conferring predisposition to RA, and that it contributes considerably to disease pathogenesis in patients that were SE negative.

18385794|t|Identification of novel mutations and sequence variants in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia.
18385794|a|PURPOSE: Mutations in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes have been reported in patients with anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia. In this study, we evaluated 34 anophthalmic/microphthalmic patient DNA samples (two sets of siblings included) for mutations and sequence variants in SOX2 and CHX10. METHODS: Conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for the initial SOX2 and CHX10 screening of 34 affected individuals (two sets of siblings), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls. Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis. Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by sequencing bidirectionally in patient samples. RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one known) in SOX2 were identified in this cohort. Mutation c.310 G>T (p. Glu104X), found in one patient, was in the region encoding the high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain and resulted in a change from glutamic acid to a stop codon. The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence. The shortened protein products may result in the loss of function. In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G>A was identified in the 3'-untranslated region in one patient. The relationship between the nucleotide change and the protein function is indeterminate. A known single nucleotide polymorphism (c. *469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 of the 34 patients. Screening of CHX10 identified two synonymous sequence variants, c.471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and c.579 G>A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP), and one non-synonymous sequence variant, c.871 G>A (p. Asp291Asn, novel SNP). The non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in healthy controls, suggesting non-causality. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of SOX2 in ocular development. Loss of SOX2 function results in severe eye malformation. CHX10 was not implicated with microphthalmia/anophthalmia in our patient cohort.

18257781|t|Co-inheritance of a PKD1 mutation and homozygous PKD2 variant: a potential modifier in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
18257781|a|BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is caused by mutations in polycystins 1 (PC1) and 2 (PC2), is one of the most commonly inherited renal diseases, affecting ~1 : 1000 Caucasians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened Greek ADPKD patients with the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) assay and direct sequencing. RESULTS: We identified a patient homozygous for a nucleotide change c.1445T > G, resulting in a novel homozygous substitution of the non-polar hydrophobic phenylalanine to the polar hydrophilic cysteine in exon 6 at codon 482 (p.F482C) of the PKD2 gene and a de-novo PKD1 splice-site variant IVS21-2delAG. We did not find this PKD2 variant in a screen of 280 chromosomes of healthy subjects, supporting its pathogenicity. The proband's parents did not have the PKD1 mutation. Real-time PCR of the PKD2 transcript from a skin biopsy revealed 20-fold higher expression in the patient than in a healthy subject and was higher in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than in those of her heterozygote daughter and a healthy subject. The greater gene expression was also supported by Western blotting. Inner medullar collecting duct (IMCD) cells transfected with the mutant PKD2 mouse gene presented a perinuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic localization compared with the wild type ER localization. Patch-clamping of PBMCs from the p.F482C homozygous and heterozygous subjects revealed lower polycystin-2 channel function than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time a patient with ADPKD who is heterozygous for a de novo PKD1 variant and homozygous for a novel PKD2 mutation.

18241046|t|A human phospholamban promoter polymorphism in dilated cardiomyopathy alters transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoids.
18241046|a|Depressed calcium handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-ATPase and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) is a key characteristic of human and experimental heart failure. Accumulating evidence indicates that increases in the relative levels of PLN to Ca-ATPase in failing hearts and resulting inhibition of Ca sequestration during diastole, impairs contractility. Here, we identified a genetic variant in the PLN promoter region, which increases its expression and may serve as a genetic modifier in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The variant AF177763.1:g.203A>C (at position -36 bp relative to the PLN transcriptional start site) was found only in the heterozygous form in 1 out of 296 normal subjects and in 22 out of 381 cardiomyopathy patients (heart failure at age of 18-44 years, ejection fraction=22+/-9%). In vitro analysis, using luciferase as a reporter gene in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, indicated that the PLN-variant increased activity by 24% compared to the wild type. Furthermore, the g.203A>C substitution altered the specific sequence of the steroid receptor for the glucocorticoid nuclear receptor (GR)/transcription factor in the PLN promoter, resulting in enhanced binding to the mutated DNA site. These findings suggest that the g.203A>C genetic variant in the human PLN promoter may contribute to depressed contractility and accelerate functional deterioration in heart failure.

18050247|t|Identification of novel susceptibility genes in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus using a uniquely designed candidate gene pathway platform.
18050247|a|OBJECTIVE: Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents a unique subgroup of patients for genetic study. The present study was undertaken to identify susceptibility genes contributing to SLE, using a novel candidate gene pathway microarray platform to investigate gene expression in patients with childhood-onset SLE and both of their parents. METHODS: Utilizing bioinformatic tools, a platform of 9,412 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,204 genes was designed and validated. Molecular inversion probes and high-throughput SNP technologies were used for assay development. Seven hundred fifty three subjects, corresponding to 251 full trios of childhood-onset SLE families, were genotyped and analyzed using transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) and multitest corrections. RESULTS: Family-based TDT showed a significant association of SLE with a N673S polymorphism in the P-selectin gene (SELP) (P = 5.74 x 10(-6)) and a C203S polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 gene (IRAK1) (P = 9.58 x 10(-6)). These 2 SNPs had a false discovery rate for multitest correction of <0.05, and therefore a >95% probability of being considered as proven. Furthermore, 7 additional SNPs showed q values of <0.5, suggesting association with SLE and providing a direction for followup studies. These additional genes notably included TNFRSF6 (Fas) and IRF5, supporting previous findings of their association with SLE pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: SELP and IRAK1 were identified as novel SLE-associated genes with a high degree of significance, suggesting new directions in understanding the pathogenesis of SLE. The overall design and results of this study demonstrate that the candidate gene pathway microarray platform used provides a novel and powerful approach that is generally applicable in identifying genetic foundations of complex diseases.

17990063|t|Clinical and molecular characterization of Italian patients affected by Cohen syndrome.
17990063|a|Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with variability in the clinical manifestations, characterized by developmental delay, visual disability, facial dysmorphisms and intermittent neutropenia. We described a cohort of 10 patients affected by Cohen syndrome from nine Italian families ranging from 5 to 52 years at assessment. Characteristic age related facial changes were well documented. Visual anomalies, namely retinopathy and myopia, were present in 9/10 patients (retinopathy in 9/10 and myopia in 8/10). Truncal obesity has been described in all patients older than 6 years (8/8). DNA samples from all patients were analyzed for mutations in COH1 by DHPLC. We detected 15 COH1 alterations most of them were truncating mutations, only one being a missense change. Partial gene deletions have been found in two families. Most mutations were private. Two were already reported in the literature just once. A single base deletion leading to p.T3708fs3769, never reported before, was found in three apparently unrelated families deriving from a restricted area of the Veneto's lowland, between Padova town and Tagliamento river, in heterozygous state. Given the geographical conformation of this region, which is neither geographically or culturally isolated, a recent origin of the mutation could be hypothesized.

17962394|t|Skewed X inactivation in an X linked nystagmus family resulted from a novel, p.R229G, missense mutation in the FRMD7 gene.
17962394|a|AIMS: This study aimed to identify the underlying genetic defect of a large Turkish X linked nystagmus (NYS) family. METHODS: Both Xp11 and Xq26 loci were tested by linkage analysis. The 12 exons and intron-exon junctions of the FRMD7 gene were screened by direct sequencing. X chromosome inactivation analysis was performed by enzymatic predigestion of DNA with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, followed by PCR of the polymorphic CAG repeat of the androgen receptor gene. RESULTS: The family contained 162 individuals, among whom 28 had NYS. Linkage analysis confirmed the Xq26 locus. A novel missense c.686C>G mutation, which causes the substitution of a conserved arginine at amino acid position 229 by glycine (p.R229G) in exon 8 of the FRMD7 gene, was observed. This change was not documented in 120 control individuals. The clinical findings in a female who was homozygous for the mutation were not different from those of affected heterozygous females. Skewed X inactivation was remarkable in the affected females of the family. CONCLUSIONS: A novel p.R229G mutation in the FRMD7 gene causes the NYS phenotype, and skewed X inactivation influences the manifestation of the disease in X linked NYS females.

17959715|t|Polymorphic MLH1 and risk of cancer after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.
17959715|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Methylating agents are effective chemotherapy agents for Hodgkin lymphoma, but are associated with the development of second primary cancers. Cytotoxicity of methylating agents is mediated primarily by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. Loss of MLH1, a major component of DNA MMR, results in tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of methylating agents and persistence of mutagenised cells at high risk of malignant transformation. We hypothesised that a common substitution in the basal promoter of MLH1 (position -93, rs1800734) modifies the risk of cancer after methylating chemotherapy. METHODS: 133 patients who developed cancer following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (n = 133), 420 patients diagnosed with de novo myeloid leukaemia, 242 patients diagnosed with primary Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1177 healthy controls were genotyped for the MLH1 -93 polymorphism by allelic discrimination polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cancer risk by MLH1 -93 polymorphism status, and stratified by previous exposure to methylating chemotherapy, were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Carrier frequency of the MLH1 -93 variant was higher in patients who developed therapy related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) (75.0%, n = 12) or breast cancer (53.3%. n = 15) after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma compared to patients without previous methylating exposure (t-AML, 30.4%, n = 69; breast cancer patients, 27.2%, n = 22). The MLH1 -93 variant allele was also over-represented in t-AML cases when compared to de novo AML cases (36.9%, n = 420) and healthy controls (36.3%, n = 952), and was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing t-AML (odds ratio 5.31, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 20.15), but only in patients previously treated with a methylating agent. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that the common polymorphism at position -93 in the core promoter of MLH1 defines a risk allele for the development of cancer after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. However, replication of this finding in larger studies is suggested.

17910065|t|A novel missense mutation in the paired domain of human PAX9 causes oligodontia.
17910065|a|PAX9 and MSX1 are transcription factors that play essential roles in craniofacial and limb development. In humans, mutations in both genes are associated with nonsyndromic and syndromic oligodontia, respectively. We screened one family with nonsyndromic oligodontia for mutations in PAX9 and MSX1. Single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous C139T transition in PAX9 in the affected members of the family. There were no mutations detected in the entire coding sequence of MSX1. The C139T mutation, predicted to result in the substitution of an arginine by a tryptophan (R47W) in the N-terminal subdomain, affected conserved residues in the PAX9 paired domain. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism producing oligodontia phenotype caused by this mutation, we analyzed the binding of wild-type and mutant PAX9 paired domain protein to double-stranded DNA targets. The R47W mutation dramatically reduced DNA binding suggesting that the mutant protein with consequent haploinsufficiency results in a clinical phenotype.

17876530|t|Role of homozygous DC-SIGNR 5/5 tandem repeat polymorphism in HIV-1 exposed seronegative North Indian individuals.
17876530|a|Despite multiple sexual exposures to HIV-1 virus, some individuals remain HIV-1 seronegative. Although several genetic factors have been related to HIV-1 resistance, the homozygosity for a mutation in CCR5 gene (the 32-bp deletion, i.e., CCR5-Delta32 allele) is presently considered the most relevant one. The C-type lectins, DC-SIGN (present on dendritic cells and macrophages) and DC-SIGNR (present on endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes) efficiently bind and transmit HIV-1 to susceptible cell in trans, thereby augmenting the infection. A potential association of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR neck domain repeat polymorphism and risk of HIV-1 infection is currently under debate. To determine the influence of host genetic factors on HIV-1 resistance, we conducted genetic risk association study in HIV-1-exposed seronegative (n = 47) individuals, HIV-1 seronegative (n = 262) healthy control, and HIV-1-infected seropositive patients (n = 168) for polymorphism in neck domain of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genes. The DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genotypes were identified by polymerase chain reaction method in DNA extracted from peripheral blood and confirmed by sequencing. Fisher exact or chi (2) test was used for static analysis. DC-SIGN genotype and allele distribution was fairly similar in HIV-1-exposed seronegative, HIV-1 seropositive, and HIV-1 seronegative control. There was no statistical significance in the differences in the distribution of DC-SIGN genotypes. A total of 13 genotypes were found in DC-SIGNR neck repeat region polymorphism. Among all the genotypes, only 5/5 homozygous showed significant reduced risk of HIV-1 infection in HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals (p = 0.009). A unique genotype 8/5 heterozygous was also found in HIV-1 seropositive individual, which is not reported elsewhere.

17710578|t|Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene polymorphism and its association with preeclampsia in Chinese women.
17710578|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether polymorphisms of angiotensin converting enzyme gene (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (AT1R) are associated with etiology of preeclampsia and renal impact in women with preeclampsia. METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 133 patients with preeclampsia and 105 healthy pregnant women. The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and the A1166C polymorphism of the AT(1)R gene was additionally assessed by DdeI digestion. The level of proteinuria, fasting serum urea, creatinine and uric acid were investigated according to different genotypes of ACE and AT1R genes. RESULTS: The frequency of genotypes of the ACE gene and the AT1R gene was similar in preeclampsia and normal pregnancy. DD and ID genotype predominated in patients with severe proteinuria, as well as increased serum urea and uric acid. Serum creatinine was also increased, but no significant difference was found among three genotypes. The level of proteinuria, serum uric acid, urea, and creatinine did not vary between different AT1R genotypes. Compared with patients without renal dysfunction, the frequency of DD and ID genotypes of ACE gene was much higher in those with renal dysfunction, but AC and CC genotypes of AT1R gene were not. CONCLUSION: We found no association of the two gene polymorphisms with preeclampsia. However, ACE gene I/D polymorphisms were associated with the severe proteinuria and renal dysfunction seen in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia patients carrying the D allele may be susceptible to renal dysfunction.

17683901|t|An improved tetra-primer PCR approach for the detection of the FGFR3 G380R mutation responsible for achondroplasia.
17683901|a|Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism and has an incidence of approximately 1/7500. In more than 98% of cases, the disease is associated with a G to A or G to C substitution at nucleotide position 1138 (p.G380R) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. We have developed a sensitive single tube tetra-primer PCR assay to detect both the c.1138G>A and c.1138G>C mutations and can successfully distinguish DNA samples that are homozygous and heterozygous for the c.1138G>A mutation. Titration studies showed that the assay could reliably detect one copy of the mutant allele in a mix of 100 wild-type alleles. The assay has been tested in 50 healthy controls, 3 known patients with achondroplasia, and 5 amniotic fluids suspected of having achondroplasia and for whom we had previously determined the genotypes for the c.1138G>A mutation by PCR-RFLP. We have observed complete concordance between methods. Our tetra-primer PCR assay is sensitive, low-cost, and easy to use method for FGFR3 p.G380R genotyping, which could be used even in "low-tech" laboratories.

17671735|t|Coincidence of mutations in different connexin genes in Hungarian patients.
17671735|a|Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of hereditary prelingual sensorineural hearing impairment in Europe. Several studies indicate that different members of the connexin protein family interact to form gap junctions in the inner ear. Mutations in different connexin genes may accumulate and, consequently lead to hearing impairment. Therefore, we screened 47 Hungarian GJB2- heterozygous (one mutation in coding exon of the GJB2 gene) patients with hearing impairment for DNA changes in two further connexin genes (GJB6 and GJB3) and in the 5' non-coding region of GJB2 including the splice sites. Eleven out of 47 GJB2-heterozygous patients analyzed carried the splice site mutation -3170G>A in the 5'UTR region of GJB2. One out of these 11 patients showed homozygous -3170G>A genotype in combination with p.R127H. Next to the GJB2 mutations we noted 2 cases of deletion in GJB6 [Delta(GJB6-D13S1830)] and 3 (2 new and 1 described) base substitutions in GJB3 [c.357C>T, c.798C>T and c.94C>T (p.R32W)] which are unlikely disease-causing. Our results suggest the importance of routine screening for the rather frequent -3170G>A mutation (in addition to c.35delG) in patients with hearing impairment.

17549393|t|A novel IRF6 nonsense mutation (Y67X) in a German family with Van der Woude syndrome.
17549393|a|Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is the most common type of syndromic orofacial cleft, which accounts for approximately 2% of all cleft lip and palate cases. It is characterised by variable association of lower lip pits, cleft lip and cleft palate, and hypodontia. VWS arises as the result of mutations in the gene encoding interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6). The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Very recently, mutations of the IRF6 gene in exons 2-9 have been found in VWS patients, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in orofacial development. We report a novel mutation of the IRF6 gene in a German family. Five out of the 12 persons affected were able to be investigated. The mutation produced a stop codon within exon 4 of the IRF6 gene. All 5 patients were heterozygous for a base substitution c.201C>A changing the tyrosine codon at amino acid position 67 into a stop codon (p.Y67X) in exon 4. The premature stop codon was responsible for a truncated protein lacking parts of the DNA- binding domain and the complete Smad-interferon regulatory factor-binding domain probably essential for interactions with the Smad transcription factors.

17327131|t|Molecular analysis of the CYP2F1 gene: identification of a frequent non-functional allelic variant.
17327131|a|The CYP2F1 is a human cytochrome P450 that is selectively expressed in lung tissue and involved in the metabolism of various pneumotoxicants with potential carcinogenic effects. In the present study, we report the first systematic investigation of the genetic polymorphism of this enzyme. We analyzed the nucleotidic sequence of the CYP2F1 gene in DNA samples from 90 French Caucasians consisting in 44 patients with lung cancer and 46 control individuals, using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of PCR products (PCR-SSCP). We identified 24 novel mutations distributed in the promoter region of the gene, as well as in the coding regions and their flanking intronic sequences. In addition to the wild-type CYP2F1*1 allele, seven allelic variant, CYP2F1*2A, *2B, *3, *4, *5A, *5B and *6, were characterized. The most frequent allelic variant, CYP2F1*2A (25.6%), harbors a combination of 9 mutations, including 2 missense mutations (Asp218Asn and Gln266His) and a 1-bp insertion (c.14_15insC) that creates a premature stop codon in exon 2, probably leading to the synthesis of a severely truncated protein with no catalytic activity. The identification of around 7% of homozygotes for the frameshift mutation in our Caucasian population suggests the existence of an interindividual variation of the CYP2F1 activity and, consequently, the possibility of interindividual differences in the toxic response to some pneumotoxicants and in the susceptibility to certain chemically induced diseases. However, our preliminary results did not show any evidence that the CYP2F1 genetic polymorphism has implications in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.

17273972|t|Human TBX1 missense mutations cause gain of function resulting in the same phenotype as 22q11.2 deletions.
17273972|a|Deletion 22q11.2 syndrome is the most frequent known microdeletion syndrome and is associated with a highly variable phenotype, including DiGeorge and Shprintzen (velocardiofacial) syndromes. Although haploinsufficiency of the T-box transcription factor gene TBX1 is thought to cause the phenotype, to date, only four different point mutations in TBX1 have been reported in association with six of the major features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Although, for the two truncating mutations, loss of function was previously shown, the pathomechanism of the missense mutations remains unknown. We report a novel heterozygous missense mutation, H194Q, in a familial case of Shprintzen syndrome and show that this and the two previously reported missense mutations result in gain of function, possibly through stabilization of the protein dimer DNA complex. We therefore conclude that TBX1 gain-of-function mutations can result in the same phenotypic spectrum as haploinsufficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations or deletions.

17250663|t|A novel mutation at the DFNA36 hearing loss locus reveals a critical function and potential genotype-phenotype correlation for amino acid-572 of TMC1.
17250663|a|We ascertained a North American Caucasian family (LMG248) segregating autosomal dominant, non-syndromic, post-lingual, progressive sensorineural hearing loss. The hearing loss begins in the second decade of life and initially affects high frequencies. It progresses to profound deafness at all frequencies by the fourth or fifth decade. The phenotype co-segregates with short-tandem repeat markers flanking the TMC1 gene at the DFNA36 locus on chromosome 9q31-q21. The affected individuals carry a novel missense substitution, p.D572H (c.G1714C), of the TMC1 gene. This mutation is at the same nucleotide and amino acid position as the only other reported DFNA36 mutation, p.D572N (c.G1714A). Our observations implicate a critical function for amino acid-572 for wild-type TMC1 function or the pathogenesis of DFNA36 hearing loss. The slower progression of hearing loss associated with p.D572H, in comparison with that caused by p.D572N, may reflect a correlation of DFNA36 phenotype with TMC1 genotype.

17192049|t|Cytochrome p4501A1 gene variants as susceptibility marker for prostate cancer.
17192049|a|CYP1A1 activates environmental procarcinogens and catalyzes oxidative metabolism of estrogens and is likely to play an important role in the etiology of prostate cancer. To evaluate this phenomenon, the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (A to G transition in exon7 leading to amino acid substitution Ile462Val and T3801C at 3'UTR) of CYP1A1 gene in prostate cancer were analyzed in a case-control study of 100 individuals in South Indian population. The estimated relative risk was significantly high for individuals with w1/m1 genotype at 3'UTR of CYP1A1 gene (OR-4.64; 95%CI = 1.51-14.86; P < 0.01) whereas the CYP1A1 Ile/Val genotype (w2/m2) on exon 7 was found to be associated with a decreased risk for prostate cancer (OR-0.17; 95%CI = 0.02-0.89; P=0.03). A Stratified analysis of the genotypes with age of onset and tumor grade showed the w1/m1 genotype to be significantly associated with an early age of onset; however the tumor grades did not have significant association with the variant genotypes. Thus the present study indicates that individuals with the variant w1/m1 genotype exhibit an increased risk while those with w2/m2 genotype exhibit a decreased risk for prostate cancer.

17169596|t|Single-base substitution at the last nucleotide of exon 6 (c.671G>A), resulting in the skipping of exon 6, and exons 6 and 7 in human succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) gene.
17169596|a|Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT, EC 2.8.3.5) is the key enzyme for ketone body utilization. Hereditary SCOT deficiency (MIM 245050) causes episodes of severe ketoacidosis. We identified a homozygous point mutation (c.671G>A) , which is a single-base substitution at the last nucleotide of exon 6, in a Turkish patient (GS12) with SCOT deficiency. This point mutation resulted in the skipping of exon 6, and exons 6 and 7 in human SCOT genes. To understand why the c.671G>A causes exons 6 and 7 skipping, nuclear RNA was separated from cytoplasmic RNA and both were analyzed by RT-PCR. In nuclear RNA, SCOT mRNA with exon 6 skipping was predominant and mRNA with exons 6 and 7 skipping was hardly detected, whereas the latter became one of major mRNA species in cytoplasmic RNA. This discrepancy was interpreted as follows: exon 6 skipping causes a frameshift and nonsense-mediated RNA decay in the cytosol, so mRNA with exon 6 skipping was unstable. On the other hand, SCOT mRNA with exons 6 and 7 is a minor transcript but it retains the reading-frame and is stable in cytosol. As a result, the latter mRNA is more abundant under steady-state conditions as compared to the former mRNA.

17083016|t|Genetic polymorphism of the binding domain of surfactant protein-A2 increases susceptibility to meningococcal disease.
17083016|a|BACKGROUND: Meningococcal disease occurs after colonization of the nasopharynx with Neisseria meningitidis. Surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D are pattern-recognition molecules of the respiratory tract that activate inflammatory and phagocytic defences after binding to microbial sugars. Variation in the genes of the surfactant proteins affects the expression and function of these molecules. METHODS: Allele frequencies of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D were determined by polymerase chain reaction in 303 patients with microbiologically proven meningococcal disease, including 18 patients who died, and 222 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Homozygosity of allele 1A1 of SP-A2 increased the risk of meningococcal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-42.4); carriage of 1A5 reduced the risk (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.97). An analysis of the multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SP-A demonstrated that homozygosity for alleles encoding lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223 in the carbohydrate recognition domain was associated with an increased risk of meningococcal disease (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.4-31.5). Carriage of alleles encoding lysine at residue 223 was found in 61% of patients who died, compared with 35% of those who survived (OR adjusted for age, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.7). Genetic variation of SP-A1 and SP-D was not associated with meningococcal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Gene polymorphism resulting in the substitution of glutamine with lysine at residue 223 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A2 increases susceptibility to meningococcal disease, as well as the risk of death.

17050029|t|Nucleotide change of codon 38 in the X gene of hepatitis B virus genotype C is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
17050029|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, the HBV X gene, which encodes the pleiotropic transactivator HBx, has also been associated with the development of HCC. In this study, we investigated whether nucleotide changes in the X gene of genotype C are associated with the development of HCC. METHODS/RESULTS: We sequenced the X gene in age- and sex-matched 39 HBV-infected patients with HCC and 36 HBV-infected patients without HCC. A novel nucleotide change that resulted in a proline to serine substitution at codon 38 in HBx (codon-38 change) was preferentially found in patients with HCC. Then, sera were collected from a new group of age- and sex-matched 52 patients with HCC and 51 patients without HCC. In this cohort also, the codon-38 change was associated with HCC. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed the prevalence of the codon-38 change was significantly associated with HCC in all patients (P=0.001, odds ratio: 4.89). CONCLUSION: The codon-38 change in genotype C is an independent risk factor for the development of HCC and may serve as a useful molecular marker for predicting the clinical outcomes in patients infected with HBV.

17000021|t|No independent role of the -1123 G>C and+2740 A>G variants in the association of PTPN22 with type 1 diabetes and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in two Caucasian populations.
17000021|a|INTRODUCTION: The PTPN22 is a negative regulator of the T cell response. Its +1858C>T (R620W) polymorphism has been shown to associate with a risk for multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The minor (susceptibility) allele is absent in Asian populations, but a recent study suggested an independent involvement of another polymorphism located within the promoter -1123 nucleotides relative to the translational start site. AIMS: We aimed to analyse the association of three PTPN22 polymorphisms in two distinct Caucasian populations, the Czechs (with T1D and with JIA) and Azeri (with T1D). METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at positions -1123 (rs2488457), +1858 (rs2476601, the R620W substitution), and +2740 (rs1217412) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 372 subjects with childhood-onset T1D, 130 subjects with JIA, and 400 control subjects of Czech origin, and in 160 subjects with T1D and 271 healthy controls of Azeri origin. RESULTS: In the Czechs, all three SNPs were in a tight linkage disequlibrium, while in the Azeri, the linkage disequlibrium was limited to between the promoter and 3'-UTR polymorphism, D'(-1123, +2740)=0.99, r(2)=0.72. Haplotype reconstruction via the expectation-maximization algorithm showed in both populations that only the haplotype containing the minor (W) allele at codon 620 was associated with T1D (OR=2.26, 95% CI 1.68-3.02 in Czechs, OR=14.8, 95% CI 2.0-651 in Azeri) or JIA (OR=2.43, 95% CI 1.66-3.56 in Czechs). The haplotypes having the wild-type (R) allele at codon 620 and minor alleles at -1123 and/or +2740 were neutral as to the risk of autoimmune conditions in both populations. CONCLUSIONS: In two different Caucasian populations, the Czechs and the Azeri, no independent contribution can be detected either of the -1123 promoter SNP or the +2740 3'-UTR SNP, and only the minor allele at PTPN22 codon 620 contributes to the risk of autoimmunity.

16970763|t|Mutations in the NDP gene: contribution to Norrie disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity.
16970763|a|BACKGROUND: To examine the contribution of mutations within the Norrie disease (NDP) gene to the clinically similar retinal diseases Norrie disease, X-linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), Coat's disease and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). METHODS: A dataset comprising 13 Norrie-FEVR, one Coat's disease, 31 ROP patients and 90 ex-premature babies of <32 weeks' gestation underwent an ophthalmologic examination and were screened for mutations within the NDP gene by direct DNA sequencing, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or gel electrophoresis. Controls were only screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Confirmation of mutations identified was obtained by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Evidence for two novel mutations in the NDP gene was presented: Leu103Val in one FEVR patient and His43Arg in monozygotic twin Norrie disease patients. Furthermore, a previously described 14-bp deletion located in the 5' unstranslated region of the NDP gene was detected in three cases of regressed ROP. A second heterozygotic 14-bp deletion was detected in an unaffected ex-premature girl. Only two of the 13 Norrie-FEVR index cases had the full features of Norrie disease with deafness and mental retardation. CONCLUSION: Two novel mutations within the coding region of the NDP gene were found, one associated with a severe disease phenotypes of Norrie disease and the other with FEVR. A deletion within the non-coding region was associated with only mild-regressed ROP, despite the presence of low birthweight, prematurity and exposure to oxygen. In full-term children with retinal detachment only 15% appear to have the full features of Norrie disease and this is important for counselling parents on the possible long-term outcome.

16843501|t|DNA damage and repair in gastric cancer--a correlation with the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes polymorphisms.
16843501|a|The cell's susceptibility to mutagens and its ability to repair DNA lesions are important for cancer induction, promotion and progression. Both the mutagens' sensitivity and the efficacy of DNA repair may be affected by variation in several genes, including DNA repair genes. The hOGG1 gene encodes glycosylase of base excision repair and RAD51 specifies a key protein in homologues recombination repair. Both can be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions, which can contribute to stomach cancer. In the present work we determined the level of basal and oxidative DNA damage and the kinetics of removal of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 gastric cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals. The metrics from DNA damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of common polymorphisms of the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes: a G-->C transversion at 1245 position of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser-->Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G-->C substitution at position 135 (5'-untranslated region) of the RAD51 gene (the G135C polymorphism). DNA damage and repair were evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) assisted by DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), preferentially recognizing oxidized DNA bases. The genotypes of the polymorphism were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. We observed a strong association between gastric cancer occurrence, impaired DNA repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between that genotype and stomach cancer occurrence in subjects with high level of oxidatively damaged DNA. We did not observe any correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired DNA repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA lesions. Therefore, our result suggest that the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene may be linked with gastric cancer by the modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and this polymorphism may be a useful additional marker in this disease along with the genetic or/and environmental indicators of oxidative stress.

16822828|t|Genotyping of five chinese patients with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency diagnosed through high-performance liquid chromatography serum adrenal profile: identification of two novel CYP17 mutations.
16822828|a|CONTEXT: 17alpha-Hydroxylase deficiency is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by CYP17 gene mutations. OBJECTIVE: Five Chinese patients with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency were genotyped. PATIENTS: The five patients derived from four families living in Shandong Province, China. The diagnosis of 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency was initially established through HPLC serum adrenal profiles in Qilu Hospital, China, from 1983-1993. RESULTS: Three CYP17 gene mutations were identified from these patients. Among them, V311fs and Y329fs are two novel frame-shifting mutations. V311fs is an 8-bp nucleotide (TTAAATGG) deletion in exon 5. Y329fs is a deletion-insertion combined mutation (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 in exon 6. Two homozygotes for Y329fs and one compound heterozygote for Y329fs and V311fs were identified from three different families. Two homozygous sisters for the D487_S488_F489 deletion were identified. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the diagnostic value of the HPLC serum adrenal profile for 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. The D487_S488_F489 deletion had been identified in two previously genotyped Chinese families. In our present study, a third Chinese family with this mutation was identified, suggesting that this mutation is a prevalent CYP17 mutation in the Chinese population. The identification of Y329fs mutation in addition to three previously identified mutations at codon 329 suggests that codon 329 is an unstable point of the CYP17 gene. The mutations identified from our five patients appear to be random, but the recurrence of the Y329fs mutation may be attributed to a founder effect. Our studies suggest that 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency may not be rare in the Chinese population.

16601880|t|Genetic heterogeneity of the GLDC gene in 28 unrelated patients with glycine encephalopathy.
16601880|a|Glycine encephalopathy, or nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH; Mckusick 238300) is a severe autosomal recessive disease due to a defect in the glycine cleavage system (GCS), which is a complex of four subunits: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins. A P-protein (glycine decarboxylase or GLDC) deficiency was reported in about 80% of NKH patients. We performed mutation analysis of the complete coding sequence of the GLDC gene in 28 unrelated patients with neonatal NKH using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing. Forty different gene alterations were identified, confirming the large molecular heterogeneity of the GLDC gene. Eighteen alterations were clearly disease-causing: two large deletions, four one-base deletions (c.28delC, c.1175delC, c.2186delC, c.2422delA), one 1-base insertion (c.1002_1003insT), one 4-base insertion (c.1285_1286insCAAA), one insertion/deletion (c.2153_2155delinsTCCTGGTTTA), five nonsense mutations (p.E153X, p.R236X, p.E270X, p.R337X, p.R424X) and four splice site mutations (c.861+1G > T, c.1402-1C > G, c.2316-1G > A, c.2919+1G > A). Additionally, we identified one intronic mutation outside the consensus splice sites (c.2838+5G > A) and 21 nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid change (including three previously described mutations: p.T269M, p.R461Q, p.G771R), the pathogenicity of which should be confirmed by expression studies (p.S132W, p.Y138F, p.G171A, p.T187K, p.R212K, p.T269M, p.R373W, p.I440N, p.R461Q, p.N533Y, p.C644F, p.H651R, p.V705M, p.N732K, p.G771R, p.H775R, p.T830M, p.A841P, p.D880V, p.S957P and p.R966G). Mutation analysis allowed us to identify sequence alterations in both alleles for 19 patients and in one allele for 7 patients One patient was carrying three mutations (p.Y138F, p.T269M and p.E153X) and one patient was carrying two amino acid substitutions on the same allele (p.V705M and p.R212K) and an unidentified mutation on the other allele. No mutation could be found in two patients, suggesting possible defects in the H-protein or gene alterations that could not be identified by our technique. The potential use of genotype determination for prenatal diagnosis is emphasized.

16418600|t|Genetic investigation of the TSPYL1 gene in sudden infant death syndrome.
16418600|a|BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) constitutes the most frequent cause of death in the postperinatal period in Germany. Recently, a lethal phenotype characterized by sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT) was identified to be caused by loss of function mutations in the TSPYL1 gene. PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to reveal a possible role of TSPYL1 in SIDS. METHODS: DNA samples of 126 SIDS cases and 261 controls were investigated. RESULTS: We found five sequence variations, each of them causing an amino acid substitution. No Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium and no significant difference in allele frequencies between patients and controls were observed for any variation. In one female patient a p.F366L amino acid polymorphism was found heterozygous, which could not be displayed in controls. A pathogenic implication of this substitution, which is conserved in primates and rodents, cannot be ruled out completely. Because SIDDT is the result of homozygous TSPYL1 mutations, this heterozygous exchange cannot solely explain the sudden death in this child. The reported mutation associated with SIDDT (457_458insG) was not detectable in our cohort. CONCLUSION: No association of sequence variations in the TSPYL1 gene and SIDS has been found in a German cohort. Genetic analysis of TSPYL1 seems to be of limited significance in the differential diagnosis of SIDS without dysgenesis of the testes.

16379540|t|Indirect CFTR mutation identification by PCR/OLA anomalous electropherograms.
16379540|a|Mutations of CFTR gene are responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) and other clinical conditions such as congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD), chronic pancreatitis (IP), and idiopathic disseminated bronchiectasis (DBE) classified as CFTR-related disorders. The PCR/OLA assay is designed to detect 31 known mutations including the 24 most common CF mutations worldwide, as identified by the CF Consortium. In order to define the CFTR genotype a series of 1812 individuals from central-southern Italy with and without CF manifestations were screened by using the PCR/OLA assay. Here we report the description of five cases of anomalous electropherograms obtained after PCR/OLA analysis, that led to the identification, in the homozygous state, of two point mutations (D110H and S589N) not included in the assay test panel, a large gene deletion (CFTRdel14b_17b), and an exonic polymorphism (c.4002A > G). Haplotype and real time PCR analysis were also performed in the subject carrying the large CFTR deletion. The study demonstrates that the PCR/OLA assay, besides being an efficient and user-friendly method to screen known mutations in the CFTR gene, may also function as a mutation/polymorphism-scanning assay, at least for certain nucleotide changes located in some critical regions of the gene.

16321363|t|Congenital disorder of glycosylation Ic due to a de novo deletion and an hALG-6 mutation.
16321363|a|We describe a new cause of congenital disorder of glycosylation-Ic (CDG-Ic) in a young girl with a rather mild CDG phenotype. Her cells accumulated lipid-linked oligosaccharides lacking three glucose residues, and sequencing of the ALG6 gene showed what initially appeared to be a homozygous novel point mutation (338G>A). However, haplotype analysis showed that the patient does not carry any paternal DNA markers extending 33kb in the telomeric direction from the ALG6 region, and microsatellite analysis extended the abnormal region to at least 2.5Mb. We used high-resolution karyotyping to confirm a deletion (10-12Mb) [del(1)(p31.2p32.3)] and found no structural abnormalities in the father, suggesting a de novo event. Our findings extend the causes of CDG to larger DNA deletions and identify the first Japanese CDG-Ic mutation.

16211251|t|A novel single-nucleotide substitution, Glu 4 Lys, in the leukotriene C4 synthase gene associated with allergic diseases.
16211251|a|Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) play important roles in bronchial asthma, and can mediate bronchial smooth muscle constriction and increase mucous secretion, vascular permeability and cellular infiltration. We identified a novel heterozygous single-nucleotide substitution 10G>A (Glu 4 Lys) in the first exon of the leukotriene C4 synthase gene (LTC4S). This substitution was detected in 5 of 141 allergic patients, but not in 110 nonallergic subjects. There was a difference in the Glu 4 Lys frequency between the allergic patients and nonallergic subjects (Fisher's exact test, p=0.0460). The five patients with Glu 4 Lys had allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma and/or allergic dermatitis. Furthermore, a familial analysis of Glu 4 Lys revealed a link with allergic diseases. Thus, our results suggest that Glu 4 Lys in the LTC4S might be associated with allergic diseases.

16157158|t|A Cys 23-Ser 23 substitution in the 5-HT(2C) receptor gene influences body weight regulation in females with seasonal affective disorder: an Austrian-Canadian collaborative study.
16157158|a|Most females with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) exhibit atypical vegetative symptoms such as overeating, and weight gain when depressed. The serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)) plays a key role in control of appetite and satiety. A 5-HT(2C) Cys 23 Ser substitution, coded for by a single nucleotide polymorphism (Cys 23 Ser) within the 5-HT(2C) gene, has been shown to influence 5-HT(2C) function. We hypothesized that Cys 23 Ser influences weight regulation in females with SAD. Two independent samples from Austria (162 females with SAD, 119 controls), and Canada (90 females with SAD, 42 controls) were genotyped for Cys 23 Ser. Influence on weight regulation was analyzed within patients with atypical features. In Austrians, genotype distribution differed between patients and controls (p=0.044) and Cys 23 Ser was associated with weight (p=0.039), body mass index (BMI; p=0.038), and seasonal appetite change (p=0.031). All values were highest in Cys/Cys, intermediate in Cys/Ser, and lowest in Ser/Ser carriers. In Canadian patients, Cys 23 Ser was associated with minimum lifetime BMI (p=0.046), with lowest values in Ser/Ser carriers. Our data provide evidence that Cys 23 Ser mediates severity of weight regulation disturbances in females with SAD, and the gene-dose effect-like differences suggest a direct functional role of Cys 23 Ser in the behavioral regulation of body weight.

16018252|t|Two novel mutations in SRY gene form Chinese sex reversal XY females.
16018252|a|The SRY gene (sex determining region on Y chromosome) acts as TDF and is required for regulating male sex determination. SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the HMG-box motif (high-mobility group-box), which acts as DNA binding region. Deletion and inactivating mutations of SRY are among the known causes of XY sex reversal. Here, we described the screening of 10 patients who presented with 46,XY sex reversal for mutations in open reading frame (ORF) of SRY gene. DNA was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques. A 609 bp fragment from the central portion of the SRY gene was amplified, using primers XES-2 and XES-7. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into the pUCm-T vectors, and direct sequencing were carried out on an ABI 377-3 automated DNA sequencer to detect the mutation. PCR-restriction enzyme digestion was applied to detect the results of DNA sequencing. In two patients,de novo mutations led to an amino acid substitution. An A was replaced by a G in codon 38 upstream of the 5' border outside the HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamate by glycine. Another heterozygous T to A transition at the nucleotide position +387 which encodes for a Tyrosine (Tyr) instead of a Term, whereas her father was proven to have the wild-type sequence. These point mutations have been confirmed with PCR-restrict enzyme method. As demonstrated by the Human Gene Mutation Database analysis,homology search, and review of the literature, these two mutations were not described previously and brought the total number of SRY gene nucleotide substitutions (missense/nonsense) to 45. These findings indicated that these amino acid substitutions may be responsible for the sex reversal,not only inside the HMG-box but also outside the HMG-box. The two novel mutations in SRY gene provided valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanism of the patient with 46,XY female sex reversal.

16000134|t|Successful therapy with argatroban for superior mesenteric vein thrombosis in a patient with congenital antithrombin deficiency.
16000134|a|A 38-year-old woman was admitted with superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis, which was refractory to anticoagulation therapy. The plasma antithrombin activity was decreased and hardly compensated by concentrated antithrombin preparation due to high consumption rate. However, successful anticoagulation was achieved by administration of direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban. Family studies of antithrombin activity revealed that she had type I congenital antithrombin deficiency. A novel heterozygous mutation in the gene for antithrombin (single nucleotide T insertion at 7916 and 7917, Glu 272 to stop in exon 4) was identified. Argatroban administration would be effective in the treatment of congenital antithrombin deficiency with SMV thrombosis.

15851735|t|Mild glycine encephalopathy (NKH) in a large kindred due to a silent exonic GLDC splice mutation.
15851735|a|BACKGROUND: Classic neonatal-onset glycine encephalopathy (GE) is devastating and life threatening. Milder, later onset variants have been reported but were usually sporadic and incompletely defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and biochemical phenotype and molecular basis of mild GE in nine children from a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindred. METHODS: Genomic DNA was screened for GLDC, AMT, and GCSH gene mutations. GLDC expression in lymphoblasts was studied by Northern blot and reverse transcriptase PCR analysis. RESULTS: Clinical features included hypotonia, abnormal movements, convulsions, and moderate mental retardation with relative sparing of gross motor function, activities of daily living skills, and receptive language. Aggression and irritability were prominent. CSF-to-plasma glycine ratio was mildly to moderately elevated. All nine patients were homozygous and their parents heterozygous for a novel, translationally silent GLDC exon 22 transversion c.2607C>A. Lymphoblast GLDC mRNA levels were considerably reduced. Three aberrantly spliced cDNA species were identified: exon 22 and exon 22 to 23 skipping, and insertion of an 87-base pair cryptic exon. Homozygosity for c.2607C>A was also identified in an unrelated but haplotypically identical patient with an unusually favorable outcome despite severe neonatal-onset GE. Mutation analysis enabled prenatal diagnosis of three unaffected and one affected pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation in this kindred led to missplicing and reduced GLDC (glycine decarboxylase) expression. The 4 to 6% of normally spliced GLDC mRNA in the patients may account for their relatively favorable clinical outcome compared with patients with classic glycine encephalopathy.

15837627|a|Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM) are clonal disorders arising from hematopoietic progenitors. An internet-based protocol was used to collect clinical information and biological specimens from patients with these diseases. High-throughput DNA resequencing identified a recurrent somatic missense mutation JAK2V617F in granulocyte DNA samples of 121 of 164 PV patients, of which 41 had homozygous and 80 had heterozygous mutations. Molecular and cytogenetic analyses demonstrated that homozygous mutations were due to duplication of the mutant allele. JAK2V617F was also identified in granulocyte DNA samples from 37 of 115 ET and 16 of 46 MMM patients, but was not observed in 269 normal individuals. In vitro analysis demonstrated that JAK2V617F is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase.

15807692|t|Identification of novel type VII collagen gene mutations resulting in severe recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
15807692|a|In this work, we studied the proband in a small nuclear family of Chinese and Dutch/German descent and identified two novel mutations in the type VII collagen gene leading to recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Hallopeau-Siemens variant (HS-RDEB). The maternal mutation is a single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide in exon 26, designated 3472delC, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination codon (PTC) within the same exon, 7 bp downstream of the site of the mutation. The paternal mutation is a G-->A transition located at the 5' donor splice site within intron 51, designated IVS51 + 1G-->A. This mutation leads to the activation of a cryptic splice site, 32 bp downstream of the mutation site and to subsequent aberrant out-of-frame splicing, resulting in two alternative mRNA transcripts and a downstream PTC. To our knowledge, these two mutations have not been previously reported. These findings extend the body of evidence for compound heterozygous mutations leading to HS-RDEB and provide the basis for prenatal diagnosis in this family.

15710861|t|Adult onset metachromatic leukodystrophy without electroclinical peripheral nervous system involvement: a new mutation in the ARSA gene.
15710861|a|BACKGROUND: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Clinically, the disease is heterogeneous with respect to the age of onset, affection of peripheral and central nervous systems, and progression. OBJECTIVES: To analyze mutations in the ARSA gene of a patient with adult-onset MLD with no signs of peripheral polyneuropathy and to emphasize the clinical, neuroradiologic, neuropathologic, and genetic features of the disease. DESIGN: Case study of a patient clinically presenting with rapidly progressive dementia and behavioral abnormalities. We report the findings of clinical evaluation and neurophysiologic and neuropathologic studies of peripheral nerves; we also performed DNA sequence analysis, transfections, metabolic labeling, and immunoprecipitation of mutant ARSA polypeptides. SETTING: Genetic research and clinical unit, university hospital. RESULTS: Genetic analysis revealed homozygosity for a novel mutation in exon 3 of ARSA (F219V). This substitution leads to a misfolded unstable enzyme with a specific activity less than 1% of normal. There were no clinical or neurophysiologic signs of peripheral nervous system dysfunction. Typical neuropathologic signs for MLD were absent from nerve biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: This novel mutation is associated with progressive psychocognitive impairment without clinical or electrophysiologic signs and only minor morphologic signs of peripheral nerve affection. The F219V substitution causes reduction in enzyme activity to an extent unexpected for an adult patient with MLD.

15642853|t|Parkin mutations and early-onset parkinsonism in a Taiwanese cohort.
15642853|a|BACKGROUND: Loss of function of the parkin gene (PRKN) is the predominant genetic cause of juvenile and early-onset parkinsonism in Japan, Europe, and the United States. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency of PRKN mutations in Taiwanese (ethnic Chinese) patients with early-onset parkinsonism and to explore genotype-phenotype correlations. DESIGN: Clinical assessment included medical, neurologic, and psychiatric evaluation. Genomic DNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to identify PRKN mutations. Gene expression was examined in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines, in which PRKN mutations were identified. PATIENTS: Forty-one Taiwanese patients with early-onset parkinsonism (aged <50 years at onset). RESULTS: Four of 41 probands had PRKN mutations. One proband had compound heterozygous mutations, with a PRKN exon 2 deletion and an exon 7 G284R substitution. The phenotype resembled typical Parkinson disease. Three patients were mutation carriers. One proband had PRKN exon 2 and exon 3 deletions in the same allele. However, this patient's phenotype was that of classic "parkin-proven" autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, characterized by symmetrical foot dystonia at onset, gait disturbance, diurnal change, and very slow progression. The 2 remaining carriers had novel heterozygous exon 11 R396G substitutions. Patients with PRKN mutations were younger at onset than those without mutations, and they required a lower dose of levodopa despite longer disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in PRKN are a rare cause of early-onset parkinsonism in Taiwanese individuals. The overall mutation frequency, adjusted for age at onset, was comparable with that reported for white cohorts; however, the point mutations identified seem to be population specific.

METHODS: Thirty-seven unrelated patients were studied, 18 with LCD and 19 with GCD. The diagnosis of LCD or GCD was made on the basis of clinical and/or histopathological evaluation. Exons and flanking intron sequences of the TGFBI gene were amplified by PCR with specific primers. PCR products were screened by the method of single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by sequencing. Mutations were confirmed by screening at least 100 unrelated normal control subjects. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 14 of 18 patients with LCD and in all 19 patients with GCD. In LCD, three novel heterozygous mutations found were glycine-594-valine (Gly594Val) in 2 of 18 patients, valine-539-aspartic acid (Val539Asp) in 1 patient, and deletion of valine 624, valine 625 (Val624-Val625del) in 1 patient. In addition, mutation of arginine 124-to-cysteine (Arg124Cys) was found in 8 of 18 patients and histidine 626-to-arginine (His626Arg) in 2 of 18 patients. Atypical clinical features for LCD were noted in patients with the Gly594Val and Val624-Val625del mutations. In GCD, 18 patients with GCD type I had a mutation of arginine 555-to-tryptophan (Arg555Trp) and 1 patient with GCD type III (Reis-Bucklers dystrophy), had the Arg124Leu mutation. Seven novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also found, of which a change of leucine 269 to phenylalanine (Leu269Phe) was found in 12 of 18 patients with the Arg555Trp mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Arg124Cys and Arg555Trp appear to be the predominant mutations causing LCD and GCD, respectively, in the population studied. The novel mutations identified in this study are associated with distinct phenotypes.

15481887|t|Two new beta-chain variants: Hb Tripoli [beta26(B8)Glu-->Ala] and Hb Tizi-Ouzou [beta29(B11)Gly-->Ser].
15481887|a|Two new beta-globin chain variants: Hb Tripoli: codon 26, GAG-->GCG [beta26(B8)Glu-->Ala] and Hb Tizi-Ouzou: codon 29, GGC-->AGC [beta29(B11)Gly-->Ser] are described on the first exon of the beta-globin gene. The two variants are characterized by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS). Hematological abnormalities were found in the two carriers. The presence of microcytosis and hypochromia is explained by an additional homozygous 3.7 kb alpha(+) thalassemic deletion for the carrier of Hb Tizi-Ouzou. Hb Tizi-Ouzou showed a slight instability in vitro. The same hematological abnormalities associated with anemia are difficult to explain for Hb Tripoli's carrier in the absence of an alpha-globin genes abnormality and could suggest a possible abnormal splicing.

15459183|t|CD72 polymorphisms associated with alternative splicing modify susceptibility to human systemic lupus erythematosus through epistatic interaction with FCGR2B.
15459183|a|We previously reported association of FCGR2B-Ile232Thr with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in three Asian populations. Because polymorphism of CD72, another inhibitory receptor of B cells, was associated with murine SLE, we identified human CD72 polymorphisms, tested their association with SLE and examined genetic interaction with FCGR2B in the Japanese (160 SLE, 277 controls), Thais (87 SLE, 187 controls) and Caucasians (94 families containing SLE members). Four polymorphisms and six rare variations were detected. The former constituted two major haplotypes that contained one or two repeats of 13 nucleotides in intron 8 (designated as *1 and *2, respectively). Although association with susceptibility to SLE was not detected, the *1 allele was significantly associated with nephritis among the Japanese patients (P=0.024). RT-PCR identified a novel alternatively spliced (AS) transcript that was expressed at the protein level in COS-7 transfectants. The ratio of AS/common isoforms was strikingly increased in individuals with *2/*2 genotype when compared with *1/*1 (P=0.000038) or *1/*2 (P=0.0085) genotypes. Using the two Asian cohorts, significant association of FCGR2B-232Thr/Thr with SLE was observed only in the presence of CD72-*1/*1 genotype (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.47-14.6, P=0.009 versus FCGR2B-232Ile/Ile plus CD72-*2/*2). Minigene assays demonstrated that the 13-nucleotide repeat and 4 bp deletion within the same haplotype of intron 8 could regulate alternative splicing. The AS isoform lacks exon 8, and is deduced to contain 49 amino acid changes in the membrane-distal portion of the extracellular domain, where considerable amino acid changes are known in CD72(c) allele associated with murine SLE. These results indicated that the presence of CD72-*2 allele decreases risk for human SLE conferred by FCGR2B-232Thr, possibly by increasing the AS isoform of CD72.

15377356|t|Features of epidermolysis bullosa simplex due to mutations in the ectodomain of type XVII collagen.
15377356|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in COL17A1, coding for type XVII collagen, cause junctional epidermolysis bullosa with an ultrastructural plane of cleavage through the lamina lucida of the epidermal basement membrane. OBJECTIVES: To identify the COL17A1 mutations in a child with reduced type XVII collagen expression and intraepidermal blister formation. PATIENT AND METHODS: Protein expression and level of tissue separation were studied by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The mutations were identified by analysing the patient's DNA and mRNA. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence microscopy performed on nonlesional skin demonstrated absence of the type XVII collagen endodomain and presence, although reduced, of the shed ectodomain. Electron microscopy showed that the plane of cleavage was through the basal cells, not through the lamina lucida. Two heterozygous mutations were identified in COL17A1: a new 3'-acceptor splice-site mutation in intron 21 (1877-2A-->C), and a deletion in exon 48 (3432delT). The splice-site mutation in intron 21 results in alternative transcripts of which two are in-frame, with deletions of the first nine codons of exon 22 and the entire exon 22, respectively. By Western blot analysis, a type XVII collagen molecule was detected that was slightly smaller than normal. CONCLUSIONS: Occasionally mutations in the COL17A1 gene may result in split levels suggesting epidermolysis bullosa simplex rather than junctional epidermolysis bullosa.

15191352|t|Severe form of thyroid hormone resistance in a patient with homozygous/hemizygous mutation of T3 receptor gene.
15191352|a|Resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (RTH) is a rare disorder, usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Patients with RTH are usually euthyroid but can occasionally present with signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or rarely with hypothyroidism. Affected individuals are usually heterozygous for mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene (TR-beta). We present a patient with RTH found to be homo-/hemizygous for a mutation in the TR-beta gene. The single nucleotide substitution I280S (1123T-->G) was present either on both alleles or in a hemizygous form with complete deletion of the second allele. The I280S mutation was recently reported in a heterozygous patient. The severe phenotype with seriously impaired intellectual development, hyperkinetic behaviour, tachycardia, hearing and visual impairment is probably due to the dominant negative effect of the I280S mutant protein and the absence of any functional TR-beta.

15148206|t|A novel arginine substitution mutation in 1A domain and a novel 27 bp insertion mutation in 2B domain of keratin 12 gene associated with Meesmann's corneal dystrophy.
15148206|a|AIM: To determine the disease causing gene defects in two patients with Meesmann's corneal dystrophy. METHODS: Mutational analysis of domains 1A and 2B of the keratin 3 (K3) and keratin 12 (K12) genes from two patients with Meesmann's corneal dystrophy was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Novel mutations of the K12 gene were identified in both patients. In one patient a heterozygous point mutation (429A-->C = Arg135Ser) was found in the 1A domain of the K12 gene. This mutation was confirmed by restriction digestion. In the second patient a heterozygous 27 bp duplication was found inserted in the 2B domain at nucleotide position 1222 (1222ins27) of the K12 gene. This mutation was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The mutations were not present in unaffected controls. CONCLUSION: Novel K12 mutations were linked to Meesmann's corneal dystrophy in two different patients. A missense mutation replacing a highly conserved arginine residue in the beginning of the helix initiation motif was found in one patient, and an insertion mutation, consisting of a duplication of 27 nucleotides, was found before the helix termination motif in the other.

15135245|t|A new but frequent mutation of apoB-100-apoB His3543Tyr.
15135245|a|ApolipoproteinB 100 (apoB-100) is an important component of atherogenic lipoproteins such as LDL and serves as a ligand for the LDL-receptor. Familial defective apolipoproteinB 100 (FDB) is caused by a R3500Q mutation of the apoB gene and results in decreased binding of LDL to the LDL-receptor. So far FDB is the most frequent and best studied alteration of apoB-100. Apart from this, three other apoB mutations, R3500W, R3531C and R3480W, affecting binding to the LDL-receptor are known to date. We screened the apoB gene segment of codons 3448-3561 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis in a total of 853 consecutively sampled German patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography for suspected CAD. By this, a new single base mutation was detected and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutation, CAC(3543)TAC results in a His3543Tyr substitution in apoB-100 (H3543Y). The prevalence of heterozygotes for H3543Y in the study population was 0.47% compared to 0.12% for the known Arg 3500 Gln (R3500Q) mutation. In conclusion, the new mutation is four times more frequent than "classical" FDB and thus appears to be the most common apoB mutation in Germany.

15122711|t|POLG mutations associated with Alpers' syndrome and mitochondrial DNA depletion.
15122711|a|Alpers' syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago. It is an autosomal recessive, developmental mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder characterized by deficiency in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease. In two unrelated pedigrees of Alpers' syndrome, each affected child was found to carry a homozygous mutation in exon 17 of the POLG locus that led to a Glu873Stop mutation just upstream of the polymerase domain of the protein. In addition, each affected child was heterozygous for the G1681A mutation in exon 7 that led to an Ala467Thr substitution in POLG, within the linker region of the protein.

15086325|t|Identification of three F5 gene mutations associated with inherited coagulation factor V deficiency in two Chinese pedigrees.
15086325|a|To investigate the molecular defects in two Chinese pedigrees with inherited factor V (FV) deficiency. A 37-year-old male (proband 1) and an 18-month-old boy (proband 2) were diagnosed as inherited coagulation FV deficiency by severely reduced plasma levels of FV activity and antigen. All 25 exons and their flanking sequence of F5 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for both probands and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Total RNA was extracted from the peripheral lymphocytes of proband 1 for detecting the changes at mRNA level. The homozygous deletion IVS8 -2A>G was identified in the F5 gene of proband 1 and complementary DNA (cDNA) analysis revealed the abolishment of the canonical splicing site by the mutation and the activation of the cryptic acceptor site 24 bp upstream instead. The insertion introduced eight additional amino acids (AA) into the FV protein. Two heterozygous mutations of F5 gene were discovered in proband 2. The 2238-9del AG in exon 13 introduced a premature termination code at 689 AA and the substitution of G6410 by T in exon 23 lead to the missense mutation Gly2079Val. Three F5 gene mutations, IVS8 -2A>G, 2238-9del AG and G6410T, have been identified in two Chinese pedigree with congenital FV deficiency, respectively.

15069170|t|Four novel mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter gene in Japanese patients with Gitelman's syndrome.
15069170|a|BACKGROUND: Gitelman's syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from inactivating mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter (NCCT) gene. To date, almost 90 mutations have been identified. It is possible that there is a population-specific distribution of mutations. In this study, we analysed mutations in the NCCT gene of seven Japanese patients with GS. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from patients with GS, their family members and healthy control subjects. A mutation analysis of the NCCT gene was performed completely by direct automated sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA products. In patients with a deletion or splice site mutation, we undertook cDNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: We identified nine mutations. Five of them [c.185C>T (Thr60Met), c.1712C>T (Ala569Val), c.1930C>T (Arg642Cys), c.2552T>A (Leu849His) and c.1932delC] have been reported in Japanese patients, but not in GS patients from other ethnic groups. The remaining four mutations [c.7A>T (Met1Leu), c.1181_1186+20del26, c.1811_1812delAT and IVS16+1G>A] were novel. In cDNA derived from a patient with c.1181_1186+20del26, a deletion of exon 9 and a frameshift at the start of exon 10 were observed. In cDNA derived from patients with IVS16+1G>A, an additional 96 bp insertion between exons 16 and 17 was observed. Six out of seven patients were compound heterozygotes, and the remaining one carried a single heterozygous mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We found four novel mutations in the NCCT gene in seven Japanese patients with GS. Moreover, our study suggests that the distribution of mutations in the NCCT gene in Japanese GS patients potentially differs from that in other populations.

15064320|t|Compound heterozygous mutations in the SRD5A2 gene exon 4 in a male pseudohermaphrodite patient of Chinese origin.
15064320|a|The goal of this study was to perform 5-alpha-reductase type 2 gene (SRD5A2) analysis in a male pseudohermaphrodite (MPH) patient with normal testosterone (T) production and normal androgen receptor (AR) gene coding sequences. A patient of Chinese origin with ambiguous genitalia at 14 months, a 46,XY karyotype, and normal T secretion under human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation underwent a gonadectomy at 20 months. Exons 1-8 of the AR gene and exons 1-5 of the SRD5A2 gene were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA. AR gene coding sequences were normal. SRD5A2 gene analysis revealed 2 consecutive mutations in exon 4, each located in a different allele: 1) a T nucleotide deletion, which predicts a frameshift mutation from codon 219, and 2) a missense mutation at codon 227, where the substitution of guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA) predicts a glutamine replacement of arginine (R227Q). Testes located in the inguinal canal showed a normal morphology for age. The patient was a compound heterozygote for SRD5A2 mutations, carrying 2 mutations in exon 4. The patient showed an R227Q mutation that has been described in an Asian population and MPH patients, along with a novel frameshift mutation, Tdel219. Testis morphology showed that, during early infancy, the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme deficiency may not have affected interstitial or tubular development.

15000256|t|Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the FMR1 gene in autistic and mentally retarded children in Japan.
15000256|a|Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in males, and patients with fragile X syndrome occasionally develop autism. It is usually caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, but in a small number of patients deletions and point mutations have been identified. We screened all 17 exons of the FMR1 gene for mutations in 90 autistic or mentally retarded children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. No mutations were found in 76 male patients. However, one female patient was heterozygous for a normal allele and a mutant allele with an A to C substitution at nucleotide 879 in exon 9. This mutation was not found in 50 controls. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the mutant transcripts were spliced aberrantly, causing premature termination of the protein synthesis. Although uncommon, point mutations in the FMR1 gene may be a cause of autism and mental retardation in Japanese patients.

14979495|t|The Arg753GLn polymorphism of the human toll-like receptor 2 gene in tuberculosis disease.
14979495|a|Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a member of the Toll-like receptor family, plays an important role in recognition of, and subsequent immune response activation against, mycobacteria. The genetic polymorphism of TLR2 (arginine to glutamine substitution at residue 753 (Arg753Gln)) has been associated with a negative influence on TLR2 function, which may, in turn, determine the innate host response to mycobacteria. The aim of the present study was to investigate the Arg753Gln single nucleotide polymorphism of the TLR2 gene in tuberculosis (TB) patients compared to healthy controls. A retrospective case/control study was carried out. The Arg753Gln polymorphism of the TLR2 gene was studied in 151 TB patients compared to 116 ethnically and age-matched healthy control subjects. The TLR2 polymorphism (adenine (A) allele) was observed in 17.9 and 7.7% of TB patients and controls, respectively. When the ratios of the three genotypes were compared between the two groups, the AA genotype was found to be more significantly associated with TB. Allele frequencies for guanine (G) and A were found to be 0.95 and 0.05 in the control group and 0.86 and 0.14 in the TB patient group, respectively. The risk of developing TB disease was increased 6.04- and 1.60-fold for carriers of the AA and GA genotypes, respectively. In conclusion, the present data suggest that the arginine to glutamine substitution at residue 753 polymorphism of the Toll-like receptor 2 gene influences the risk of developing tuberculosis.

14742428|t|Structural and biochemical basis for novel mutations in homozygous Israeli maple syrup urine disease patients: a proposed mechanism for the thiamin-responsive phenotype.
14742428|a|Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from mutations affecting different subunits of the mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. In this study, we identified seven novel mutations in MSUD patients from Israel. These include C219W-alpha (TGC to TGG) in the E1alpha subunit; H156Y-beta (CAT to TAT), V69G-beta (GTT to GGT), IVS 9 del[-7:-4], and 1109 ins 8bp (exon 10) in the E1beta subunit; and H391R (CAC to CGC) and S133stop (TCA to TGA) affecting the E2 subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Recombinant E1 proteins carrying the C219W-alpha or H156Y-beta mutation show no catalytic activity with defective subunit assembly and reduced binding affinity for cofactor thiamin diphosphate. The mutant E1 harboring the V69G-beta substitution cannot be expressed, suggesting aberrant folding caused by this mutation. These E1 mutations are ubiquitously associated with the classic phenotype in homozygous-affected patients. The H391R substitution in the E2 subunit abolishes the key catalytic residue that functions as a general base in the acyltransfer reaction, resulting in a completely inactive E2 component. However, wild-type E1 activity is enhanced by E1 binding to this full-length mutant E2 in vitro. We propose that the augmented E1 activity is responsible for robust thiamin responsiveness in homozygous patients carrying the H391R E2 mutation and that the presence of a full-length mutant E2 is diagnostic of this MSUD phenotype. The present results offer a structural and biochemical basis for these novel mutations and will facilitate DNA-based diagnosis for MSUD in the Israeli population.

14673473|t|Haplotypes and DNA sequence variation within and surrounding the transthyretin gene: genotype-phenotype correlations in familial amyloid polyneuropathy (V30M) in Portugal and Sweden.
14673473|a|Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is a lethal autosomal dominant disorder in which fibrils derived from mutant forms of transthyretin (TTR), the normal plasma carrier of thyroxine (T(4)) and retinol-binding protein, are deposited in tissues. Over 80 TTR sequence variants are associated with FAP, but the amino-acid substitutions alone do not completely explain the variability in disease penetrance, pathology and clinical course. To analyze the factors possibly contributing to this phenotypic variability, we characterized the variations within the wild-type and mutant (Val30Met) TTR genes and their flanking sequences by performing extended microsatellite haplotype analyses, sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotyping of genomic DNA from Portuguese and Swedish carriers of V30M. We identified 10 new polymorphisms in the TTR untranslated regions, eight resulting from single-base substitutions and two arising from insertion/deletions in dinucleotide repeat sequences. The data suggest that the onset of symptoms of FAP V30M may be modulated by an interval downstream of TTR on the accompanying noncarrier chromosome (defined by microsatellites D18S457 and D18S456), but not by the immediately 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences of TTR. During the course of these studies, we also encountered the first instance in which the previously described intragenic haplotype III may be associated with V30M FAP in the Portuguese population.

14576201|t|Novel polypyrimidine variation (IVS46: del T -39...-46) in ABCA1 causes exon skipping and contributes to HDL cholesterol deficiency in a family with premature coronary disease.
14576201|a|Recent studies have implicated mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, ABCA1, as a cause of Tangier disease (TD) and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (FHA). We investigated a proband with very low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, 6 mg/dL) and a history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Sequencing of the ABCA1 gene revealed 2 distinct variants. The first mutation was a G5947A substitution (R1851Q). The second mutation was a single-nucleotide deletion of thymidine in a polypyrimidine tract located 33 to 46 bps upstream to the start of exon 47. This mutation does not involve the 3' acceptor splice site and is outside the lariat branchpoint sequence (IVS46: del T -39...-46). Amplification of cDNA obtained in cultured fibroblasts of the proband and affected family member revealed an abnormally spliced cDNA sequence with skipping of exon 47. These variants were not identified in over 400 chromosomes of healthy whites. Compound heterozygotes (n=4) exhibited the lowest HDL-C (11+/-5 mg/dL) and ApoA-I (35+/-15 mg/dL) compared with wild-type (n=25) (HDL-C 51+/-14 mg/dL; ApoA-I 133+/-21 mg/dL) (P<0.0005) or subjects affected with either R1851Q (n=6) (HDL-C 36+/-8; ApoA-I 117+/-19) or IVS46: del T -39...-46 (n=5) (HDL-C 31+9; ApoA-I 115+28 (P<0.01). These data suggest that polypyrimidine tract variation may represent a novel mechanism for altered splicing and exon skipping that is independent of traditional intronic variants as previously identified in acceptor/donor splice regions or the lariat branchpoint domain.

14510916|t|Progressive decline of vasopressin secretion in familial autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus presenting a novel mutation in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene.
14510916|a|OBJECTIVE: Familial autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is a rare form of central diabetes insipidus (DI), which is caused by mutations in the vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene. The present study evaluated the AVP secretion over time and analysed the structure of the AVP-NPII gene in a Brazilian family with FNDI. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Four affected members and one nonaffected member from one Brazilian family with FNDI were studied. The diagnosis of central DI was established by fluid deprivation test and hypertonic saline infusion. Two affected members were assessed twice within a 6-year interval. For molecular analysis, genomic DNA was extracted and the AVP-NPII gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The functional assessment of patients with FNDI over time confirmed a progressive loss in AVP secretion. Two patients were first diagnosed as partial central DI and, several years later, they developed severe central DI. Sequencing analysis revealed a heterozygous new point mutation in the nucleotide 1892 in the coding sequence for neurophysin-II of the AVP-NPII gene (1892G>C) predicting an amino acid substitution (A68P) in all affected members. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate a gradual vasopressinergic deficiency due to a novel mutation in the AVP-NPII gene in a Brazilian family with FNDI. The accumulation of A68P mutated precursor might have a cytotoxicity effect, leading to a gradual death of magnocellular neurones, and a progressive decline in AVP secretion.

14510914|t|Congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the sodium/iodide symporter protein.
14510914|a|OBJECTIVE: Iodide transport defect (ITD) is a rare disorder characterised by an inability of the thyroid to maintain an iodide gradient across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells, that often results in congenital hypothyroidism. When present the defect is also found in the salivary glands and gastric mucosa and it has been shown to arise from abnormalities of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). PATIENT: We describe a woman with hypothyroidism identified at the 3rd month of life. The diagnosis of ITD was suspected because of nodular goitre, and little if any iodide uptake by the thyroid and salivary glands. Treatment with iodide partially corrected the hypothyroidism; however, long-term substitution therapy with L-thyroxine was started. MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid radioiodide uptake was only 1.4% and 0.3% at 1 and 24 h after the administration of recombinant human TSH. The saliva to plasma I- ratio was 1.1 indicating that the inability of the thyroid gland to concentrate I- was also present in the salivary glands. RESULTS: Analysis of the patient's NIS gene revealed a 15 nucleotide (nt) deletion of the coding sequence (nt 1314 through nt 1328) and the insertion of 15 nt duplicating the first 15 nt of the adjacent intron. The patient was homozygous for this insertion/deletion, while both consanguineous parents were heterozygous. This deletion predicts the production of a protein lacking the five terminal amino acids of exon XI (439-443) which are located in the 6th intracellular loop. COS-7 cells transfected with a vector expressing the mutant del-(439-443) NIS failed to concentrate iodide, suggesting that the mutation was the direct cause of the ITD in this patient. CONCLUSION: In conclusion we describe the first Italian case of congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the NIS gene.

12968672|t|Cdx-2 polymorphism in the promoter region of the human vitamin D receptor gene determines susceptibility to fracture in the elderly.
12968672|a|A Cdx-2 binding site polymorphism (G to A) in the promoter region of the human vitamin D receptor gene was reported. In an ecological study in eight ethnic groups and an association study in 2848 elderly whites, we found the A-allele to be associated with decreased fracture risk. Our findings expand previous similar findings in a Japanese study to whites and show a relationship with fracture risk of this functional polymorphism. INTRODUCTION: A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within a binding site of the intestinal-specific transcription factor Cdx-2 in the promoter region of the human vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene was previously reported. It was found to modulate the transcription of the hVDR gene and to be associated with decreased bone mineral density in a small group of postmenopausal Japanese women. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the VDR Cdx-2 genotype and risk of fracture. METHODS: We first determined the location of this SNP in the VDR gene by sequencing analysis, and we developed an allele-specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction test to determine the Cdx-2 genotype. We then performed an ecological study in eight ethnic groups and an association analysis in a large epidemiological cohort of 2848 Dutch white men and women, > or = 55 years old. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The location of the G to A substitution was found in the promoter region of exon le (le-G-1739A) of the VDR gene. By comparing the frequency of the A-allele in eight different ethnic groups, we observed a negative correlation between prevalence of the A-allele and published hip fracture incidence rates in these ethnic groups (p = 0.006 for men and p = 0.02 for women), suggesting a protective effect of this allele on fracture risk. Subsequently, in the association study, the A-allele (population frequency 19%) was observed to have a protective effect on occurrence of osteoporotic fractures, especially for nonvertebral fracture in women (relative risk of AA versus GG genotype is 0.2; 95% CI, 0.05-0.8). This effect remained after adjustment for age, weight, and bone mineral density. We conclude that the A-allele of the VDR Cdx-2 polymorphism is present in whites, albeit at low frequency, and show a protective effect of this allele on risk of fracture.

12925722|t|A glycine to aspartic acid substitution of COL2A1 in a family with the Strudwick variant of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia.
12925722|a|BACKGROUND: Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) is one of a clinically heterogeneous group of skeletal disorders, characterized by defective growth and modelling of the spine and long bones. Common clinical features include disproportionate short stature, malformed vertebrae and abnormal epiphyses or metaphyses. Some cases have been associated with mutations in the COL2A1 gene. AIM: To determine whether the autosomal dominant Strudwick-type SEMD in a three-generation family, showing specific phenotypical features such as chest deformity, limb shortening, myopia and early-onset degenerative osteoarthrosis, might be caused by a novel COL2A1 mutation. DESIGN: Genetic testing and clinical examination of family members. METHODS: Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from the COL2A1 gene. RESULTS: A point mutation within exon 20 of the COL2A1 gene was identified that substituted a glycine for an aspartic acid residue at codon 262. DISCUSSION: All previously reported autosomal dominant mutations causing SEMD have substituted an obligate glycine within the triple helix, in particular at codons 292, 304 and 709 in the three reported Strudwick-type patients. Additionally, a recurrent glycine substitution at codon 154 has been identified in two unrelated Finnish cases with radiological features consistent with the Strudwick subtype. Our sixth helical glycine substitution extends the mutational spectrum and genotype/phenotype correlations of Strudwick-type SEMD.

12898858|t|Genetic polymorphisms of renin-angiotensin system and progression of interstitial nephritis.
12898858|a|Genes of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are involved in the progression of renal failure. Among them, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) genes are of particular interest. We examined polymorphisms of these three genes for association with the development of interstitial nephritis and progression to end-stage renal failure. The allele frequency and genotype distribution were compared in 90 patients with interstitial nephritis and 200 healthy controls. DNA samples were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We did not find statistically significant differences between groups in the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene. An involvement of M235T polymorphism of the AGT gene in renal disease was observed in our study. The frequency of the T allele was higher in patients than in controls (32% vs. 24%). In the A1166C AT1R polymorphism the homozygous CC genotype was also more frequent in interstitial nephritis patients (7% vs. 3.5%). In patients carrying the C allele, an average time to ESRD was significantly shorter than in subjects with the AA genotype. Our study shows the association of the AGT and AT1R gene polymorphisms with the development and progression of interstitial nephritis. The C allele of the A1166C polymorphism appears to be a risk factor for faster disease progression.

12809638|a|We describe three novel mutations in the human arylsulfatase A gene in three patients with MLD, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. An insertion, 2590_2591insCCCC in exon 8 and a deletion, 752_758delGCCGGCC, in exon 3 will both result in frameshifts. A mutation in exon 8, 2566T-->C, results in a missense mutation C488R, disrupting an unusual cysteine-knot at the C-terminal end of the protein. All three mutations are heterozygous with previously documented mutations. A previously reported mutation, R84Q was identified on a pseudodeficiency allele. These mutations are part of a heterogeneous spectrum of mutations found in a collection of DNA samples from MLD patients from across Canada and the USA.

12752111|t|The molecular basis for the thalassaemias in Sri Lanka.
12752111|a|The beta-globin gene mutations and the alpha-globin genes of 620 patients with the phenotype of severe to moderate thalassaemia from seven centres in Sri Lanka were analysed. Twenty-four beta-globin gene mutations were identified, three accounting for 84.5% of the 1240 alleles studied: IVSI-5 (G-->C) 56.2%; IVSI-1 (G-->A) 15.2%; and haemoglobin E (codon (CD)26 GAG-->GAA) 13.1%. Three new mutations were found; a 13-bp deletion removing the last nucleotide in CD6 to CD10 inclusively, IVSI-129 (A-->C) in the consensus splice site, and a frame shift, CD55 (-A). The allele frequency of alpha+ thalassaemia was 6.5% and 1.1% for -alpha3.7 and -alpha4.2 deletions respectively. Non-deletion alpha-thalassaemia was not observed. Triplicate or quadruplicate alpha-globin genes were unusually common. In 1.5% of cases it was impossible to identify beta-thalassaemia alleles, but in Kurunegala detailed family studies led to an explanation for the severe thalassaemia phenotype in every case, including a previously unreported instance of homozygosity for a quadruplicated alpha-globin gene together with beta-thalassaemia trait. These findings have implications for the control of thalassaemia in high-frequency populations with complex ethnic histories.

12750403|t|Pacemaker channel dysfunction in a patient with sinus node disease.
12750403|a|The cardiac pacemaker current I(f) is a major determinant of diastolic depolarization in sinus nodal cells and has a key role in heartbeat generation. Therefore, we hypothesized that some forms of "idiopathic" sinus node dysfunction (SND) are related to inherited dysfunctions of cardiac pacemaker ion channels. In a candidate gene approach, a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (1631delC) in exon 5 of the human HCN4 gene was detected in a patient with idiopathic SND. The mutant HCN4 protein (HCN4-573X) had a truncated C-terminus and lacked the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with HCN4-573X cDNA indicated normal intracellular trafficking and membrane integration of HCN4-573X subunits. Patch-clamp experiments showed that HCN4-573X channels mediated I(f)-like currents that were insensitive to increased cellular cAMP levels. Coexpression experiments showed a dominant-negative effect of HCN4-573X subunits on wild-type subunits. These data indicate that the cardiac I(f) channels are functionally expressed but with altered biophysical properties. Taken together, the clinical, genetic, and in vitro data provide a likely explanation for the patient's sinus bradycardia and the chronotropic incompetence.

12729343|t|NRAMP1 genetic polymorphisms as a risk factor of tuberculous pleurisy.
12729343|a|SETTING: Nrampl encoded by the NRAMP1 gene influences the phagolysosomal function of alveolar macrophage against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Genetic polymorphisms of NRAMP1 affect innate host resistance through the defective production and function of Nrampl. OBJECTIVE: To investigate this relationship, the NRAMP1 polymorphisms in patients with tuberculous pleurisy were determined. DESIGN: Pleural biopsy proven 56 patients were designated to the pleurisy group and 45 healthy adults were designated to the healthy control group. Three NRAMP1 polymorphisms such as single nucleotide change in intron 4(469 + 14G/C, INT4), a non-conservative single-base substitution at codon 543(D543N) and TGTG deletion in the 3' untranslated region (1729 + 55del4, 3'UTR) were determined. RESULTS: The frequencies of mutant genotypes of INT4 and 3'UTR were significantly high in the pleurisy group (P = 0.01, P = 0.02), but the frequencies of D543N were not significantly different between the two groups. Odds ratios (OR), which are a comparison of the wild with the mutant genotype, were 8.02 (95%CI 2.42 approximately 26.57) for INT4 and 5.73 (95%CI 1.14 approximately 28.92) for 3'UTR which were statistically significant. In the combined analysis of the INT4 and 3'UTR, the ORs were 6.00 (95%CI 1.46 approximately 24.64) for GC/++ genotype and 14.00 (95%CI 1.61 approximately 121.75) for GC/+del when compared with GG/++; these differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The NRAMP1 genetic polymorphisms, especially INT4 and 3'UTR, were closely related to tuberculous pleurisy.

12673366|t|Analysis of the G/C polymorphism in the 5'-untranslated region of the RAD51 gene in breast cancer.
12673366|a|The breast cancer suppressor proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 interact with RAD51, a protein essential for maintaining genomic stability by playing a central role in homology-dependent recombinational repair of the DNA double-strand breaks. Therefore, genetic variability in the RAD51 gene may contribute to the appearance and/or progression of breast cancer. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'- untranslated region of RAD51 (a G to C substitution at position 135, the G/C polymorphism) is reported to modulate breast cancer risk. We investigated the distribution of genotypes and frequency of alleles of the G/C polymorphism in breast cancer. Tumor tissues were obtained from postmenopausal women with node-negative and node-positive breast carcinoma with uniform tumor size. Blood samples from age matched healthy women served as control. The G/C polymorphism was determined by PCR-based MvaI restriction fragment length polymorphism. The distribution of the genotypes of the G/C polymorphism did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) from those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg distribution. There were no differences in the genotype distribution and allele frequencies between node-positive and node-negative patients. There were no significant differences between distributions of the genotypes in subgroups assigned to histological grades according to Scarf-Bloom-Richardson criteria and the distribution predicted by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). Our study implies that the G/C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene may not be directly involved in the development and/or progression of breast cancer and so it may not be useful as an independent marker in this disease.

12653841|t|Restricted genetic defects underlie human complement C6 deficiency.
12653841|a|Complement C6 homozygous deficiency (C6D) has been rarely observed in Caucasians but was reported at higher prevalence among African-Americans. We report on the molecular basis of C6D in seven unrelated black individuals of North or Central Africa descent who live in France. These patients have presented Neisseria meningitidis infection (four cases), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis with hyalinosis (one case), systemic lupus erythematosus (one case) or Still's disease (one case). All patients exhibited undetectable antigenic C6 by using a sensitive ELISA assay. An additional four cases of complete C6 deficiency with no associated disease have been characterized after family studies. Exons 6, 7 and 12 have been described recently as the location of molecular defects on the C6 gene in randomly chosen black Americans. Genomic DNA from the seven patients were subjected to direct polymerase chain reaction amplification of these three exons. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of the amplified DNA fragments revealed a homozygous single-base deletion (1936delG) in exon 12 in three cases and four compound heterozygous deletions for a single base in exon 7 (1195delC) or in exon 6 (878delA) associated with the same deletion in exon 12 (1936delG). Our observations further establish the restricted pattern of genetic defects associated with homozygous C6 complement deficiency in individuals of African descent.

21738389|t|A novel DFNB31 mutation associated with Usher type 2 syndrome showing variable degrees of auditory loss in a consanguineous Portuguese family.
21738389|a|PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect of a consanguineous Portuguese family with rod-cone dystrophy and varying degrees of decreased audition. METHODS: A detailed ophthalmic and auditory examination was performed on a Portuguese patient with severe autosomal recessive rod-cone dystrophy. Known genetic defects were excluded by performing autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) genotyping microarray analysis and by Sanger sequencing of the coding exons and flanking intronic regions of eyes shut homolog-drosophila (EYS) and chromosome 2 open reading frame 71 (C2orf71). Subsequently, genome-wide homozygosity mapping was performed in DNA samples from available family members using a 700K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray. Candidate genes present in the significantly large homozygous regions were screened for mutations using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The largest homozygous region (~11 Mb) in the affected family members was mapped to chromosome 9, which harbors deafness, autosomal recessive 31 (DFNB31; a gene previously associated with Usher syndrome). Mutation analysis of DFNB31 in the index patient identified a novel one-base-pair deletion (c.737delC), which is predicted to lead to a truncated protein (p.Pro246HisfsX13) and co-segregated with the disease in the family. Ophthalmic examination of the index patient and the affected siblings showed severe rod-cone dystrophy. Pure tone audiometry revealed a moderate hearing loss in the index patient, whereas the affected siblings were reported with more profound and early onset hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel truncating mutation in DFNB31 associated with severe rod-cone dystrophy and varying degrees of hearing impairment in a consanguineous family of Portuguese origin. This is the second report of DFNB31 implication in Usher type 2.

22051099|t|Variation in the CXCR1 gene (IL8RA) is not associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
22051099|a|BACKGROUND: The chemokine receptor 1 CXCR-1 (or IL8R-alpha) is a specific receptor for the interleukin 8 (IL-8), which is chemoattractant for neutrophils and has an important role in the inflammatory response. The polymorphism rs2234671 at position Ex2+860G>C of the CXCR1 gene causes a conservative amino acid substitution (S276T). This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) seemed to be functional as it was associated with decreased lung cancer risk. Previous studies of our group found association of haplotypes in the IL8 and in the CXCR2 genes with the multifactorial disease chronic periodontitis. In this study we investigated the polymorphism rs2234671 in 395 Brazilian subjects with and without chronic periodontitis. FINDINGS: Similar distribution of the allelic and genotypic frequencies were observed between the groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism rs2234671 in the CXCR1 gene was not associated with the susceptibility to chronic periodontitis in the studied Brazilian population.

22188495|t|A case of Werner syndrome without metabolic abnormality: implications for the early pathophysiology.
22188495|a|Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive progeroid disorder caused by mutations in the WRN DNA helicase. It is characterized by the graying and loss of hair, juvenile cataracts, sclerosis and ulceration of skin, insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, abdominal adiposity, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and malignant neoplasm. Patients are usually diagnosed in their 30s or 40s, but the early pathophysiology of the syndrome is still not fully understood. Here we report a 29-year-old female patient who displayed cataracts, hair graying, and tendinous calcinosis. Her parents were first cousins. Interestingly, the patient lacked the metabolic signs typical for WS, including glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and visceral fat accumulation. A hyperinsulinemic response at 30 min was observed in an oral glucose tolerance test. Mutational analysis for the WRN gene revealed a homozygous nucleotide substitution 3190C>T in exon 24, resulting in a protein product with replacement of an arginine residue at position 573 by termination codon (Arg987Ter). The mutated WRN protein was unable to translocate into the nucleus in an in vitro cell assay. A WS patient with an Arg987Ter mutation has been previously reported in Switzerland, the present case is the first to be identified in Asia. This case demonstrates the early clinical features of WS and suggests that metabolic abnormality, including insulin resistance, is not an essential component of WS at disease onset. Moreover, a follow-up study of such case would be useful to understand how the various clinical symptoms in WS develop and progress over the years.

21559944|t|A complete deficiency of Hyaluronoglucosaminidase 1 (HYAL1) presenting as familial juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
21559944|a|We describe a single consanguineous family with three affected children exhibiting knee and/or hip pain associated with swelling. Detailed clinical evaluation demonstrated diffuse joint involvement with an unusual proliferative synovitis on MRI. Synovial biopsies were notable for an infiltration of macrophages with abundant cytoplasm filled with faintly basophilic vacuoles. We used homozygosity mapping with a panel of 262,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to identify a homozygous stretch of 40.52  Mb on chromosome 3p22.3 - 3p13 that segregated with the arthropathy in the family. Of the 378 genes in the interval, the three hyaluronoglucosaminidase genes were considered good candidates based on the phenotype. Dideoxy sequencing identified a homozygous deletion in HYAL1, c.104delT, resulting in a premature termination codon, p.Val35AlafsX25, found in all three affected children. Enzymatic analysis confirmed total HYAL1 deficiency in the three affected children. This confirms the diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis IX (MPS IX) which has only been described in a single patient to date. In contrast to the previously described MPS IX patient, our three patients display a phenotype limited to the joints, suggesting that this is the primary manifestation of HYAL1 deficiency.

21798259|t|WT1 mutations and polymorphisms in Southeast Asian acute myeloid leukemia.
21798259|a|Genomic alterations of the Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) gene have been reported to occur in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). No data presently exists regarding the frequency of WT1 mutations in the Southeast Asian AML population. This study focused on WT1 exons 7-10 mutations and their correlation with other molecular markers and patients' characteristics. The zinc finger domain of WT1 gene covering exons 7-10 was directly sequenced. Six types of mutations were identified among 49 cases (12.24%); 4 localized on exon 7 and 2 on exon 9. Two novel mutations were identified including the insertion within codon 313 and codon 314. Patients harboring WT1 mutations seemed to have a younger age (29.5 vs 45.4 years), a higher white blood cell count (120.3 vs 19.8 10(9)/L), and a lower platelet count (54.2 vs 104.3 10(9)/L) as compared to those without the mutations although statistical differences could not be demonstrated. All exon 7 mutations were frameshift mutations and had NRAS mutation while exon 9 mutations were base substitutions and had FLT3-ITD mutation. Interestingly, the major allele for rs16754 single nucleotide polymorphism was G (25-homozygous and 6-heterozygous) which was in contrast to A in the Western reports. The frequency of WT1 mutation in the Southeast Asian AML was thus comparable to the figures reported from the West although the designated major allele for rs16754 polymorphism was different.

21897748|t|A recurrent missense mutation in GJA3 associated with autosomal dominant cataract linked to chromosome 13q.
21897748|a|PURPOSE: To map and identify the genetic defect underlying autosomal dominant cataract segregating in a 5-generation Caucasian American family. METHODS: Genomic DNA was prepared from blood leukocytes, genotyping was performed using microsatellite markers, and logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores were calculated using the LINKAGE programs. Mutation profiling was performed using direct exon cycle-sequencing and restriction fragment analysis. Protein function effects were evaluated using in silico prediction algorithms. RESULTS: Significant evidence of linkage was obtained at marker D13S175 (maximum LOD score [Z(max)]=3.67; maximum recombination fraction [  (max)]=0.04) and D13S1316 (Z(max)=2.80,   (max)=0.0). Haplotyping indicated that the disease lay in the ~170 Kb physical interval between D13S1316 and D13S175, which contained the gene for gap-junction protein alpha-3 (GJA3) or connexin-46. Sequencing of GJA3 detected a heterozygous transition (c.130G>A) in exon-2 that resulted in gain of an Hsp92 II restriction site. Allele-specific PCR amplification and restriction analysis confirmed that the novel Hsp92 II site co-segregated with cataract in the family but was not detected in 192 normal unrelated individuals. The c.130G>A transition was predicted to result in a non-conservative substitution of valine-to-methionine at codon 44 (p.V44M) with damaging effects on protein function. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm GJA3 as one of the most frequently mutated genes that underlie autosomal dominant cataract in humans, and further emphasize the importance of connexin function in maintaining lens transparency.

21757944|t|A 13-bp deletion in the 3' untranslated region of the b-globin gene causes b-thalassemia major in compound heterozygosity with IVSII-1 mutation.
21757944|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe hematological and molecular features of a 13-bp deletion in the 3' untranslated region(3' UTR) of the b-globin gene in carrier individuals and a compound heterozygous patient. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Five members of an Iranian family of Persian ethnic origin were studied. Red blood cell indices and hemoglobin analysis were carried out according to standard methods. Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood cells by salting-out procedures. b-Globin gene amplification and DNA sequencing were performed. RESULTS: One patient had a 13-bp deletion in the 3' UTR of the b-globin gene that causes the b-thalassemia phenotype in combination with the IVSII-1 (G > A) mutation. The patient had inherited the IVSII-1 (G > A) mutation from his mother, while the second b-globin gene (inherited paternally) had a 13-bp deletion at nucleotide 90 downstream of the termination codon (CD +90 del 13 bp).The patient's father and paternal grandmother, who are carriers of this deletion, had no hematological abnormalities. CONCLUSION: This case showed a patient with a 13-bp deletion in the 3' UTR of b-globin gene that could cause a slight decrease in the stability of the mRNA, but did not have a hematological effect in the heterozygotes. The 13-bp deletion could be clinically important only in situations where b-chain synthesis in trans is compromised.

22129472|t|The Arabic allele: a single base pair substitution activates a 10-base downstream cryptic splice acceptor site in exon 12 of LDLR and severely decreases LDLR expression in two unrelated Arab families with familial hypercholesterolemia.
22129472|a|Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic autosomal dominant disorder caused by defects in LDLR. Few reports describe FH mutations among Arabs. We describe a mutation in LDLR of two unrelated Arab families. We investigated 19 patients using DNA sequencing, RFLP, and real-time (RT) PCR. DNA sequencing showed a base pair substitution (c.1706-2 A>T) in the splice acceptor site of LDLR intron 11. Our results were confirmed by RFLP on 2% agarose gel. In silico analysis predicted a new cryptic splice site downstream of the original position generating a 10-base deletion from the beginning of exon 12; (c.1706-1715del.ATCTCCTCAG). cDNA sequencing of exon 12 confirmed the computational analysis. The deletion was visualized on 4% agarose gel. The deletion generates a frameshift and a premature termination codon (c.1991-1993; p.(Asp569Valfs*93). RT-PCR revealed that LDLR mRNA is 9.3%  6.5 and 17.9%  8.0 for FH homozygote and heterozygote individuals respectively, compared to a healthy family control. We predict a class II LDLR mutation that leads to a truncated receptor missing exons 14-18. We called this mutation "the Arabic allele". We expect a significant contribution of this mutation to the prevalence of FH among Arabs. Also, we propose that the severe down regulation of LDLR mRNA expression is due to nonsense-mediated-decay.

21682595|t|XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphism and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in the Polish population.
21682595|a|It has been shown that DNA repair is reduced in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and that the X-ray repair cross-complementing (XRCC1) Arg399Gln (rs25487) polymorphism may contribute to DNA repair. We evaluated the frequency of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln substitution in patients with SLE (n=265) and controls (n=360) in a sample of the Polish population. The odds ratio (OR) for SLE patients with the Gln/Gln versus Gln/Arg or Arg/Arg genotypes was 1.553 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.9573-2.520; p=0.0729). OR for the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg versus Arg/Arg genotype was 1.551 (95% CI=1.122-2.144, p=0.0077). The OR for the 399 Gln allele in patients with SLE was 1.406 (95% CI=1.111-1.779, p=0.0045). There was also a statistically significant p-value of the   (2) test for the trend observed in the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism (ptrend=0.0048). We also found a significant contribution of the Gln/Gln or Arg/Gln versus Arg/Arg genotype to the presence of either the malar rash or photosensitivity manifestations of SLE OR=2.241 (1.328-3.781, p=0.0023, pcorr=0.0414). Moreover, the meta-analysis of Taiwanese Han Chinese, Brazilian, and Polish populations showed that the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg genotype and Gln allele were associated with SLE incidence. OR for the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg versus Arg/Arg genotype was 1.440 (95% CI=1.15-1.80, p=0.0019) and OR for the Gln allele was 1.27 (95% CI=1.08-1.51, p=0.0051). Our studies may confirm that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism may increase the risk of incidence of SLE and the occurrence of some SLE manifestations.

21054465|t|Mutational analysis of CYP2C8 in hypertensive patients using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography.
21054465|a|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: CYP2C8 is involved in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase pathway. Arachidonic acid metabolites such as epoxyeicosatrienenoic acids and hydroxyeicosatetrenoic acids, produced may have a role in hypertension. We aimed to develop a medium through-put method for screening samples of known and new mutations of CYP2C8 using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). METHODS: DNA samples from 200 subjects (hypertensive patients and healthy controls) were screened for SNPs in CYP2C8 using DHPLC. Genotypes and allelic frequencies of CYP2C8 between the healthy controls and patients with hypertension were compared. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: Six variants were detected and two were new; T deletion at 5063 and substitution of C to T at 33468 in exon 8. Differences in variant frequencies were detected between the controls and hypertensive patients. The controls have significantly higher prevalence of C35322C compared to the patients. The functional significance of the SNP at 35322 requires further study. Having homozygous C35322C could be a protective factor for hypertension. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography is useful for population screening to identify new and existing SNPs. A higher frequency of the C35322T SNP was observed among hypertensive patients than control subjects. This potentially important observation requires confirmation and the clinical significance assessed.

20648600|t|High frequency of lamivudine resistance mutations in Brazilian patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B.
20648600|a|This study analyzed the genotype distribution and frequency of lamivudine (LAM) and tenofovir (TDF) resistance mutations in a group of patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). A cross-sectional study of 847 patients with HIV was conducted. Patients provided blood samples for HBsAg detection. The load of HBV was determined using an "in-house" real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBV genotypes/subgenotypes, antiviral resistance, basal core promoter (BCP), and precore mutations were detected by DNA sequencing. Twenty-eight patients with co-infection were identified. The distribution of HBV genotypes among these patients was A (n = 9; 50%), D (n = 4; 22.2%), G (n = 3; 16.7%), and F (n = 2; 11.1%). Eighteen patients were treated with LAM and six patients were treated with LAM plus TDF. The length of exposure to LAM and TDF varied from 4 to 216 months. LAM resistance substitutions (rtL180M + rtM204V) were detected in 10 (50%) of the 20 patients with viremia. This pattern and an accompanying rtV173L mutation was found in four patients. Three patients with the triple polymerase substitution pattern (rtV173L + rtL180M + rtM204V) had associated changes in the envelope gene (sE164D + sI195M). Mutations in the BCP region (A1762T, G1764A) and in the precore region (G1896A, G1899A) were also found. No putative TDF resistance substitution was detected. The data suggest that prolonged LAM use is associated with the emergence of particular changes in the HBV genome, including substitutions that may elicit a vaccine escape phenotype. No putative TDF resistance change was detected after prolonged use of TDF.

20846357|t|A novel mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) in a child with clinical and histological features of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome.
20846357|a|BACKGROUND: Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare congenital ectodermal disorder, caused by heterozygous missense mutation in GJB2, encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26. The commonest mutation is the p.Asp50Asn mutation, and only a few other mutations have been described to date. AIM: To report the fatal clinical course and characterize the genetic background of a premature male neonate with the clinical and histological features of KID syndrome. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and used for PCR amplification of the GJB2 gene. Direct sequencing was used for mutation analysis. RESULTS: The clinical features included hearing impairment, ichthyosiform erythroderma with hyperkeratotic plaques, palmoplantar keratoderma, alopecia of the scalp and eyelashes, and a thick vernix caseosa-like covering of the scalp. On histological analysis, features characteristic of KID syndrome, such as acanthosis and papillomatosis of the epidermis with basket-weave hyperkeratosis, were seen. The skin symptoms were treated successfully with acitretin 0.5 mg/kg. The boy developed intraventricular and intracerebral haemorrhage, leading to hydrocephalus. His condition was further complicated by septicaemia and meningitis caused by infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Severe respiratory failure followed, and the child died at 46 weeks of gestational age (13 weeks postnatally). Sequencing of the GJB2 gene showed that the child was heterozygous for a novel nucleotide change, c.263C>T, in exon 2, leading to a substitution of alanine for valine at position 88 (p.Ala88Val). CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a new heterozygous de novo mutation in the Cx26 gene (c.263C>T; p.Ala88Val) leading to KID syndrome.

21325775|t|A novel apolipoprotein E mutation, ApoE Osaka (Arg158 Pro), in a dyslipidemic patient with lipoprotein glomerulopathy.
21325775|a|Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by the presence of thrombuslike deposition in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and is often accompanied by an increased serum apolipoprotein E (apoE) level. Several gene mutations of apoE have been reported to be associated with LPG. In the current study, we report an LPG patient with a novel apoE mutation, apoE Osaka. The patient was a 45-year-old man who was hospitalized due to nephrotic syndrome. Light and electron microscopic observations of renal biopsy clearly showed characteristic findings of LPG, including lamellate thrombi in the lumen of dilated glomerular capillaries. His apoE phenotype was apoE3/2 and he had mild dyslipidemia with a mid-band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is intriguing that the serum apoE level was within normal limits. We determined the sequence of the apoE gene using direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. ApoE gene analysis showed a nucleotide substitution of G to C at codon 158 of exon 4. This mutation denoted an amino acid substitution of arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158 of apoE. The result of PCR associated with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis also suggested that this mutation is heterozygous. It is possible that apoE Osaka mutation causes a conformational change of apoE protein and affects the interaction between abnormal apoE-containing lipoproteins and the endothelial cells of glomerular capillaries. The precise mechanism of LPG related with apoE Osaka, however, remains to be elucidated.

21108633|a|Heterozygous humans for PAX2 mutations show autosomal dominant papillorenal syndrome (PRS), consisting of ocular colobomas, renal hypo/dysplasia and progressive renal failure in childhood. PAX2 mutations have also been identified in patients with isolated renal hypo/dysplasia. Twenty unrelated children and young adults with kidney and urinary tract malformations and no ocular abnormalities were retrospectively recruited for PAX2 mutational analysis. All patients had undergone renal transplantation after end-stage renal disease. We identified two new sequence variations: (i) a deletion causing a frameshift (c.69delC) and (ii) a nucleotide substitution determining a splice site mutation (c.410+5 G/A) by predictive analysis. Therefore, we suggest PAX2 molecular analysis to be extended to all patients with congenital malformations of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT).

21099701|t|Familial pycnodysostosis: identification of a novel mutation in the CTSK gene (cathepsin K).
21099701|a|BACKGROUND: Pycnodysostosis, an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, is characterized by short stature, osteosclerosis, delayed cranial suture closure, hypoplastic mandible, acro-osteolysis, hypoplastic clavicle, and dental anomalies. The disorder is caused by CTSK gene defects, a gene localized on 1q21. PURPOSE: To describe the clinical, radiological, and molecular findings in a family with pycnodysostosis. METHODS: The CTSK gene was analyzed from genomic DNA in a nonconsanguinity Mexican family with 3 affected members with pycnodysostosis and 100 healthy controls. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: We identified the novel homozygous mutation c.908G>A within exon 8 of the CTSK gene. This missense mutation leads to the substitution of the amino acid glycine at position 303 by glutamic acid (G303E) in cathepsin K protease. No genotype/phenotype correlation was present in affected members of the family with pycnodysostosis.

20738799|a|Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (AEC) syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by ankyloblepharon (congenital adhesions of the eyelids), ectodermal dysplasia, and orofacial clefts. Here, we report the case of an infant born with severe ectodermal dysplasia including generalized neonatal erosions with scalp involvement, facial clefting but notably without ankyloblepharon. Mutational analysis of the p63 gene showed a novel heterozygous T>C nucleotide substitution on exon 14 (I597T). To our knowledge, this is a novel mutation that has not previously been reported in the pathogenesis of AEC, or other p63-related syndromes. This case further highlights the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of p63 syndromes.

20801104|t|Association study of polymorphisms in the promoter region of DRD4 with schizophrenia, depression, and heroin addiction.
20801104|a|This study investigated the possible association between three functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene and schizophrenia, depression, and heroin addiction. Genomic DNA was isolated from the venous blood leukocytes of 322 unrelated patients with schizophrenia, 156 patients with depression, 300 patients with heroin addiction, and 300 healthy unrelated individuals. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of DRD4 (-120 bp duplication, -616C/G, and -521C/T) were genotyped using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. Genotype and allele were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 software. Results of this analysis indicated that there is a strong finding of -120 bp duplication allele frequencies with schizophrenia (p=0.008) and weak finding with -1240 L/S and for paranoid schizophrenia (p=0.022). Interestingly, there is a stronger finding with -521 C/T allele frequencies with heroin dependence (p=0.0002). These observations strongly suggest that the -120-bp duplication polymorphism of DRD4 is associated with schizophrenia and that the -521 C/T polymorphism is associated with heroin addiction.

21135151|t|Impact of CCR5delta32 host genetic background and disease progression on HIV-1 intrahost evolutionary processes: efficient hypothesis testing through hierarchical phylogenetic models.
21135151|a|The interplay between C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) host genetic background, disease progression, and intrahost HIV-1 evolutionary dynamics remains unclear because differences in viral evolution between hosts limit the ability to draw conclusions across hosts stratified into clinically relevant populations. Similar inference problems are proliferating across many measurably evolving pathogens for which intrahost sequence samples are readily available. To this end, we propose novel hierarchical phylogenetic models (HPMs) that incorporate fixed effects to test for differences in dynamics across host populations in a formal statistical framework employing stochastic search variable selection and model averaging. To clarify the role of CCR5 host genetic background and disease progression on viral evolutionary patterns, we obtain gp120 envelope sequences from clonal HIV-1 variants isolated at multiple time points in the course of infection from populations of HIV-1-infected individuals who only harbored CCR5-using HIV-1 variants at all time points. Presence or absence of a CCR5 wt//\32 genotype and progressive or long-term nonprogressive course of infection stratify the clinical populations in a two-way design. As compared with the standard approach of analyzing sequences from each patient independently, the HPM provides more efficient estimation of evolutionary parameters such as nucleotide substitution rates and d(N)/d(S) rate ratios, as shown by significant shrinkage of the estimator variance. The fixed effects also correct for nonindependence of data between populations and results in even further shrinkage of individual patient estimates. Model selection suggests an association between nucleotide substitution rate and disease progression, but a role for CCR5 genotype remains elusive. Given the absence of clear d(N)/d(S) differences between patient groups, delayed onset of AIDS symptoms appears to be solely associated with lower viral replication rates rather than with differences in selection on amino acid fixation.

21070631|t|The dopamine b-hydroxylase -1021C/T polymorphism is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in the Epistasis Project.
21070631|a|BACKGROUND: The loss of noradrenergic neurones of the locus coeruleus is a major feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dopamine b-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyses the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline. Interactions have been reported between the low-activity -1021T allele (rs1611115) of DBH and polymorphisms of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, IL1A and IL6, contributing to the risk of AD. We therefore examined the associations with AD of the DBH -1021T allele and of the above interactions in the Epistasis Project, with 1757 cases of AD and 6294 elderly controls. METHODS: We genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the three genes, DBH, IL1A and IL6. We used logistic regression models and synergy factor analysis to examine potential interactions and associations with AD. RESULTS: We found that the presence of the -1021T allele was associated with AD: odds ratio = 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.4, p = 0.005). This association was nearly restricted to men < 75 years old: odds ratio = 2.2 (1.4-3.3, 0.0004). We also found an interaction between the presence of DBH -1021T and the -889TT genotype (rs1800587) of IL1A: synergy factor = 1.9 (1.2-3.1, 0.005). All these results were consistent between North Europe and North Spain. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive, previous evidence (reviewed here) indicates an important role for noradrenaline in the control of inflammation in the brain. Thus, the -1021T allele with presumed low activity may be associated with misregulation of inflammation, which could contribute to the onset of AD. We suggest that such misregulation is the predominant mechanism of the association we report here.

21405999|t|Mutation screening of the GUCA1B gene in patients with autosomal dominant cone and cone rod dystrophy.
21405999|a|Background: Heterozygous mutations in GUCA1A (MIM # 600364) have been identified to cause autosomal dominantly inherited cone dystrophy, cone rod dystrophy and macular dystrophy. However, the role of GUCA1B gene mutations in inherited retinal disease has been controversial. We therefore performed a mutation analysis of the GUCA1B gene in a clinically well characterized group of patients of European and North-American geographical origin with autosomal dominantly inherited cone dystrophy and cone rod dystrophy. Material and Methods: Twenty-four unrelated patients diagnosed with cone dystrophy or cone rod dystrophy according to standard diagnostic criteria and a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance were included in the study. Mutation analysis of all coding exons of the GUCA1B gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and subsequent DNA sequencing. Results: Three different sequence variants, c.-17T>C, c.171T>C, c.465G>T were identified. The sequence variant c.465G>T encodes a conservative amino acid substitution, p.Glu155Asp, located in EF-hand 4, the calcium binding site of GCAP2 protein. All sequence variants were previously reported in healthy subjects. Conclusion: The absence of clearly pathogenic mutations in the selected patient group suggests that the GUCA1B gene is a minor cause for retinal degenerations in Europeans or North-Americans.

20709368|t|The fibrinogen gamma 10034C>T polymorphism is not associated with Peripheral Arterial Disease.
20709368|a|Conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin plays an essential role in hemostasis and results in stabilization of the fibrin clot. Fibrinogen consists of three pairs of non-identical polypeptide chains, encoded by different genes (fibrinogen alpha [FGA], fibrinogen beta [FGB] and fibrinogen gamma [FGG]). A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region of the FGG gene (FGG 10034C>T, rs2066865) has been associated with deep venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Aim of the present study was to analyze the role of this polymorphism in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The study was designed as case-control study including 891 patients with documented PAD and 777 control subjects. FGG genotypes were determined by exonuclease (TaqMan) assays. FGG genotype frequencies were not significantly different between PAD patients (CC: 57.3%, CT: 36.7%, TT: 5.8%) and control subjects (CC: 60.9%, CT: 33.5%, TT 5.6%; p=0.35). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, diabetes, arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, the FGG 10034 T variant was not significantly associated with the presence of PAD (Odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.84 - 1.37; p = 0.60). The FGG 10034C>T polymorphism was furthermore not associated with age at onset of PAD. We conclude that the thrombophilic FGG 10034 T gene variant does not contribute to the genetic susceptibility to PAD.

21493871|t|Multilocus association of genetic variants in MLL, CREBBP, EP300, and TOP2A with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanics from Texas.
21493871|a|BACKGROUND: Hispanic children have both a higher incidence and a poorer outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Moreover, a higher incidence for therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia with 11q23 translocations after treatment with topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors has been observed in Hispanic children with ALL. We sought to determine the potential role of genetic variants within the topoisomerase IIa gene (TOP2A), within the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) and two of its translocation partners, cyclin AMP response element-binding protein gene (CREBBP) and E1A binding protein gene (EP300) in the increased sensitivity of Hispanic children with ALL to topo II inhibitors. METHODS: Fifty-two tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) covering the four genes were genotyped in 241 samples (66 children with ALL and 175 age matched controls) of self-identified Hispanic origin. RESULTS: Two SNPs within MLL (rs525549 and rs6589664) and three SNPs within EP300 (rs5758222, rs7286979, and rs20551) were significantly associated with ALL (P = 0.001-0.04). A significant gene-dosage effect for increasing numbers of potential high-risk genotypes (OR = 16.66; P = 2   10(-5)) and a major haplotype significantly associated with ALL (OR = 5.68; P = 2   10(-6)) were found. Replication in a sample of 137 affected White children and 239 controls showed that only rs6589664 (MLL) was significantly associated in this ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the association between ALL and common genetic variants within MLL and EP300 is population specific. IMPACT: Replication of our findings in independent Hispanic populations is warranted to elucidate the role of these variants in ALL susceptibility and define their importance in the ethnic specific differences in ALL risk.

20801540|t|Hepatic but not brain iron is rapidly chelated by deferasirox in aceruloplasminemia due to a novel gene mutation.
20801540|a|BACKGROUND _#38; AIMS: Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease associated with brain and liver iron accumulation which typically presents with movement disorders, retinal degeneration, and diabetes mellitus. Ceruloplasmin is a multi-copper ferroxidase that is secreted into plasma and facilitates cellular iron export and iron binding to transferrin. RESULTS: A novel homozygous ceruloplasmin gene mutation, c.2554+1G>T, was identified as the cause of aceruloplasminemia in three affected siblings. Two siblings presented with movement disorders and diabetes. Complementary DNA sequencing showed that this mutation causes skipping of exon 14 and deletion of amino acids 809-852 while preserving the open reading frame. Western blotting of liver extracts and sera of affected patients showed retention of the abnormal protein in the liver. Aceruloplasminemia was associated with severe brain and liver iron overload, where hepatic mRNA expression of the iron hormone hepcidin was increased, corresponding to the degree of iron overload. Hepatic iron concentration normalized after 3 and 5months of iron chelation therapy with deferasirox, which was also associated with reduced insulin demands. During short term treatment there was no clinical or imaging evidence for significant effects on brain iron overload. CONCLUSIONS: Aceruloplasminemia can show an incomplete clinical penetrance but is invariably associated with iron accumulation in the liver and in the brain. Iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia is a result of defective cellular iron export, where hepcidin regulation is appropriate for the degree of iron overload. Iron chelation with deferasirox was effective in mobilizing hepatic iron but has no effect on brain iron.

20512659|t|Mutation and association analysis of GEN1 in breast cancer susceptibility.
20512659|a|GEN1 was recently identified as a key Holliday junction resolvase involved in homologous recombination. Somatic truncating GEN1 mutations have been reported in two breast cancers. Together these data led to the proposition that GEN1 is a breast cancer predisposition gene. In this article we have formally investigated this hypothesis. We performed full-gene mutational analysis of GEN1 in 176 BRCA1/2-negative familial breast cancer samples and 159 controls. We genotyped six SNPs tagging the 30 common variants in the transcribed region of GEN1 in 3,750 breast cancer cases and 4,907 controls. Mutation analysis revealed one truncating variant, c.2515_2519delAAGTT, which was present in 4% of cases and 4% of controls. We identified control individuals homozygous for the deletion, demonstrating that the last 69 amino acids of GEN1 are dispensable for its function. We identified 17 other variants, but their frequency did not significantly differ between cases and controls. Analysis of 3,750 breast cancer cases and 4,907 controls demonstrated no evidence of significant association with breast cancer for six SNPs tagging the 30 common GEN1 variants. These data indicate that although it also plays a key role in double-strand DNA break repair, GEN1 does not make an appreciable contribution to breast cancer susceptibility by acting as a high- or intermediate-penetrance breast cancer predisposition gene like BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1 and PALB2 and that common GEN1 variants do not act as low-penetrance susceptibility alleles analogous to SNPs in FGFR2. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate the importance of undertaking appropriate genetic investigations, typically full gene screening in cases and controls together with large-scale case-control association analyses, to evaluate the contribution of genes to cancer susceptibility.

20454699|t|Identification and characterization of a novel TACSTD2 mutation in gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy.
20454699|a|PURPOSE: To study the clinical, histological, in vivo confocal microscopic, and molecular profile in a family with gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDLD) from north India. METHODS: Two siblings from a consanguineous family presented with clinical features analogous to GDLD. Detailed clinical evaluations were performed for all the available affected and unaffected members of this family. In vivo confocal microscopy and histology was done wherever necessary. DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing to detect mutations in the tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2) gene. Protein modeling studies were done to asses the effect of the mutation on the protein structure. RESULTS: The diagnosis of GDLD was established in the patient and the affected sibling on slit-lamp examinations, which revealed mulberry-like opacities in the subepithelium and anterior stroma that were confirmed on histopathology. The findings of the in vivo confocal microscopy were consistent with those reported in previous reports. Sequencing TACSTD2 revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation c.356G>A, leading to amino acid substitution C119Y in the two affected siblings. The mutation was found to be pathogenic on Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) analysis and was not found in normal controls and unaffected individuals of the family. A synonymous, previously reported, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs13267) was also seen in all the individuals of the family. Protein modeling studies involving wild-type and mutant protein indicated an exposed cysteine residue in the mutant protein. CONCLUSIONS: A novel TACSTD2 C119Y mutation leading to an amino acid substitution was identified in two affected siblings of a family. Protein modeling studies revealed an exposed cysteine residue, which might cause interchain disulfide bond formation and protein aggregation leading to disturbed cell junctions of the corneal epithelium.

20367983|t|Mutation analysis in a Chinese family with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
20367983|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome which is caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1. This study aimed to identify mutations in a Chinese pedigree with MEN1. METHODS: A large Chinese family with MEN1 was collected. All of the coded regions and their adjacent sequences of the MEN1 gene were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: In this family, a heterozygous cytosine insertion in exon 10 (c.1546_1547insC) inducing a frame shift mutation of MEN1 was found in the proband and the other two suffering members of his family. This mutation was linked to a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 3 (IVS3 + 18C > T). CONCLUSIONS: The mutation in exon 10 of MEN1 gene might induce development of parathyroid hyperplasia and pituitary adenoma and cosegregate with MEN1 syndrome. The significance of the new found IVS3 + 18C > T of MEN1 needs a further investigation.

20335448|t|A novel point mutation in helix 10 of the human glucocorticoid receptor causes generalized glucocorticoid resistance by disrupting the structure of the ligand-binding domain.
20335448|a|CONTEXT: Generalized glucocorticoid resistance syndrome is a rare familial or sporadic condition characterized by partial insensitivity to glucocorticoids, caused by mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene. Most of the reported cases are adults, demonstrating symptoms associated with mineralocorticoid and/or adrenal androgen excess caused by compensatively increased secretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone. PATIENT: We identified a new 2-yr-old female case of generalized glucocorticoid resistance syndrome. The patient (TJ) presented with a generalized seizure associated with hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. She also had hypertension and premature pubarche, whereas dexamethasone effectively suppressed these clinical manifestations. RESULTS: The patient's GR gene had a heterozygotic mutation (G-->A) at nucleotide position 2141 (exon 8), which resulted in substitution of arginine by glutamine at amino acid position 714 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the GR alpha. Molecular analysis revealed that the mutant receptor had significantly impaired transactivation activity with a 2-fold reduction in affinity to ligand. It showed attenuated transactivation of the activation function (AF)-2 and reduced binding to a p160 nuclear receptor coactivator. Computer-based structural analysis revealed that replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 714 transmitted a conformational change to the LBD and the AF-2 transactivation surface, resulting in a decreased binding affinity to ligand and to the LXXLL coactivator motif. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone treatment is effective in controlling the premature pubarche, hypoglycemia, hypertension, and hypokalemia in this child case, wherein arginine 714 plays a key role in the proper formation of the ligand-binding pocket and the AF-2 surface of the GR alpha LBD.

20331852|t|Mutation analysis of the LCE3B/LCE3C genes in Psoriasis.
20331852|a|BACKGROUND: An association between a common deletion comprising the late cornified envelope LCE3B and LCE3C genes (LCE3C_LCE3B-del) and Psoriasis (Ps) has been reported. The expression of these LCE genes was induced after skin barrier disruption and was also strong in psoriatic lesions. The damage to the skin barrier could trigger an epidermal response that includes the expression of genes involved in the formation of skin barrier. METHODS: We determined the LCE3C_LCE3B-del genotype in 405 Ps patients and 400 healthy controls from a Northern Spain region (Asturias). These patients and controls were also genotyped for the rs4112788 single nucleotide polymorphism, in strong linkage disequilibrium with the LCE3C_B cluster. The LCE3B and LCE3C gene variant was determined in the patients through SSCA, DHPLC, and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and controls for the rs4112788 and LCE3C_LCE3B-del polymorphisms. However, del/del homozygotes were significantly higher among patients with chronic plaque type Ps who did not develop arthritis (p = 0.03; OR = 1.4; 95%CI = 1.03-1.92). The analysis of the coding sequence of LCE3B and LCE3C in the patients who had at least one copy of this showed that only one patient has a no previously reported LCE3B variant (R68C). CONCLUSION: Our work suggested that homozygosity for a common LCE3C_LCE3B deletion contributes to the risk of developing chronic plaque type Ps without psoriatic arthritis. Our work confirmed previous reports that described an association of this marker with only skin manifestations, and supported the concept of different genetic risk factors contributing to skin and joint disease.

20154289|t|Molecular diversity of hemoglobin H disease in India.
20154289|a|This study was undertaken to evaluate the variable clinical expression of hemoglobin (Hb) H disease in India. For the study, alpha genotyping was done in 8 patients with Hb H disease using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. The study revealed that 4 genotypes (- -(SEA)/ -alpha(3.7), - -(SA)/-alpha(3.7), - -(SEA)/-alpha(3.7 Sallanches), - -alpha(3.7)/-alpha(3.7 Sallanches)) were responsible for Hb H disease, the alpha+ thalassemia mutation (-alpha(3.7) deletion) being the most common defect. The nondeletional mutation Hb Sallanches (alpha 2 codon 104 G --> A) was seen in 3 cases. Two unique and novel genotypes leading to Hb H disease were characterized (- -(SEA)/-alpha(3.7 Sallanches) and -alpha(3.7)/-alpha(3.7 Sallanches)). Because a majority of patients with Hb H disease do not have severe manifestations, prenatal diagnosis is usually unwarranted in India.

20080916|t|Promoter insertion/deletion in the IRF5 gene is highly associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in distinct populations, but exerts a modest effect on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
20080916|a|OBJECTIVE: We examined the genetic association of the promoter insertion/deletion (indel) in IRF5 gene with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in distinct populations and assessed its role in gene expression. METHODS: Four IRF5 polymorphisms were genotyped in 1488 SLE patients and 1466 controls. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: The promoter indel and rs2070197 had independent genetic effects, which accounted for the association of rs2004640 and rs10954213. Gene expression analysis revealed that rs10954213 exerted the greatest influence on IRF5 transcript levels. CONCLUSION: We corroborated the association of the promoter indel with SLE in 5 different populations and revealed that rs10954213 is the main single-nucleotide polymorphism responsible for altered IRF5 expression in PBMC.

20019594|t|Novel mutations identification in exon 4 of LDLR gene in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia in a Venezuelan population.
20019594|a|Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and premature coronary artery disease. In Venezuela, the molecular basis of FH has not been characterized, thus, the aim of this study was to investigate mutations in the exon 4 of the LDLR (LDL-receptor) gene in 225 Venezuelan mixed race individuals (65 hypercholesterolemic and 160 normolipidemic). The exon 4 of the LDLR gene was screened by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Additionally, ApoB-100 gene mutations were investigated. Different LDLR gene mutations were identified in 5 hypercholesterolemic patients (7.7%), 3 missense mutations (4.6%), and 2 frameshift mutations (3%). All mutations were heterozygous. The missense mutations included the amino acid substitution p.E180K, p.R194S, and p.C152G. The frameshift mutations are caused by insertions resulting in the creation of stop codons: p.D157fsX158 and p.S173fsX174, which could code for truncated LDLR of 157 and 173 amino acids, respectively. The apoB gene mutations were not detected in any of our patients and to our knowledge 4 mutations identified in this study have not been reported previously, this study being the first comprehensive mutation analysis of the LDLR causing FH in our region. The early identification of individuals at risk allows changes in lifestyle, including dietary intervention, followed by drug treatment.

19881468|t|hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and risk of lung cancer by histological type.
19881468|a|Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) has a major role in the repair of 8-hydroxyguanine, a major promutagenic DNA lesion. The genetic polymorphism rs1052133, which leads to substitution of the amino acid at codon 326 from Ser to Cys, shows functional differences, namely a decrease in enzyme activity in hOGG1-Cys326. Although several studies have investigated the association between rs1052133 and lung cancer susceptibility, the effect of this locus on lung cancer according to histology remains unclear. We therefore conducted a case-control study with 515 incident lung cancer cases and 1030 age- and sex-matched controls without cancer, and further conducted a meta-analysis. In overall analysis, the homozygous Cys/Cys genotype showed a significant association with lung cancer compared to Ser allele carrier status (odds ratio (OR)=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-1.69). By histology-based analysis, the Cys/Cys genotype showed a significantly positive association with small-cell carcinoma (OR=2.40, 95% CI=1.32-4.49) and marginally significant association with adenocarcinoma (OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.98-1.77). A meta-analysis of previous and our present study revealed that this polymorphism is positively associated with adenocarcinoma, although suggestive associations were also found for squamous- and small-cell lung cancers. These results indicate that rs1052133 contributes to the risk of adenocarcinoma of lung.

19823838|t|TNF receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome caused by sequence alterations in exonic splicing enhancers: comment on the article by Tr  benbach et al.
19823838|a|Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), an autosomal disease belonging to human autoinflammatory syndromes, is caused by mutations in Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene. Tr  benbach and colleagues described a patient with two heterozygotic nucleotide transversions in exon 4 of TNFRSF1A gene: the first is a substitution from guanine to cytosine at position 263 of the nucleotide sequence (c.263 G>C); the second is a substitution from cytosine to adenine at position 264 (c.264 C>A); the two mutations affect the amino acid number 88 of the protein. To date, this was the first report of a double monoallelic mutation in a gene related to autoinflammatory syndromes. Using two web interfaces (ESEfinder and RESCUE-ESE), we provide evidence that the double nucleotide change may affect an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), a sequence element distinct from the canonical splice sites that are needed for normal splicing. ESEs are short and degenerate sequences found within coding exons and required for efficient splicing and splice site recognition. In order to verify if these changes really affect an ESE, it would be useful to analyze the described index case TNFRSF1A cDNA, because if this analysis will evidence an exon skipping in the TNFRSF1A coding sequence, it would then represent the first mutation in autoinflammatory syndromes demonstrated to be caused by ESE elements alteration.

19781362|t|Mutation analysis of p63 gene in the first Chinese family with ADULT syndrome.
19781362|a|BACKGROUND: ADULT syndrome (acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia disorder known as autosomal dominant inheritance. Recent studies have linked p63 gene mutation to the development of this disease. However, the genetic characteristics of ADULT syndrome were still not well understood. METHODS: Mutation analysis of p63 gene in the first Chinese ADULT syndrome family was performed using direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The sequence analysis of exon 8 of p63 gene disclosed a heterozygous G>A substitution at nucleotide 893 (R298Q) in the proband. In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16864880 in the downstream flanking region (DFR) of p63 exon 8 was also identified in this family. The proband and the paternal side including her father exhibited the C/G genotype at this position. The C/G variant frequency in the paternal was significantly higher as compared with the maternal (6/10 vs 0/6, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: ADULT syndrome may be caused by the p63 gene mutation, and it might have closer genetic association with the paternal side in this family.

19624485|t|The HLA-G 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism is a putative susceptible factor for active human cytomegalovirus infection in children.
19624485|a|Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) expression is a potential factor for the pathogenesis of virus infection. A 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs16375) in the 3'-untranslated region of the HLA-G gene is involved in the stability of HLA-G mRNA and HLA-G protein expression. Therefore, the HLA-G 14 bp polymorphism might be involved in human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection. To test a possible association between the HLA-G 14 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism and the active hCMV infection, in this study, a total of 54 patients with active hCMV infection and 165 age- and sex-matched, unrelated, normal Chinese Han population were genotyped for the 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism. Association of 14 bp polymorphism with hCMV urine DNA copies and the odds ratio (OR) of the polymorphism as a risk factor for active hCMV infection were analyzed. Our results showed that the prevalence of -14 bp/ -14 bp genotype in active hCMV patients was markedly increased [P(c) = 0.00034, OR = 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.77-6.18], and similar significance was also observed for the frequency of -14 bp allele (P c = 0.0023, OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.38-3.64) when compared with that of healthy controls. Furthermore, urine hCMV DNA copies in patients with the -14 bp/ -14 bp genotype were significantly higher than those in patients with the +14 bp/ +14 bp genotype (P = 0.041). Our findings support a potential role of HLA-G 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism as a susceptible factor for the active hCMV infection.

19565319|t|Adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (ADORA2A) variants may increase autistic symptoms and anxiety in autism spectrum disorder.
19565319|a|Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous disorders presenting with increased rates of anxiety. The adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (ADORA2A) is associated with panic disorder and is located on chromosome 22q11.23. Its gene product, the adenosine A(2A) receptor, is strongly expressed in the caudate nucleus, which also is involved in ASD. As autistic symptoms are increased in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and large 22q11.2 deletions and duplications have been observed in ASD individuals, in this study, 98 individuals with ASD and 234 control individuals were genotyped for eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ADORA2A. Nominal association with the disorder was observed for rs2236624-CC, and phenotypic variability in ASD symptoms was influenced by rs3761422, rs5751876 and rs35320474. In addition, association of ADORA2A variants with anxiety was replicated for individuals with ASD. Findings point toward a possible mediating role of ADORA2A variants on phenotypic expression in ASD that need to be replicated in a larger sample.

19429592|t|RPGR ORF15 genotype and clinical variability of retinal degeneration in an Australian population.
19429592|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) are estimated to cause up to 20% of all Caucasian retinitis pigmentosa and up to 75% of cases of X-Linked RP (XLRP). Exon open reading frame 15 (ORF15) is a purine-rich mutation hotspot. Mutations in RPGR ORF15 have also been documented to cause X linked cone-rod dystrophy (XLCORD) and atrophic macular degeneration at an unknown frequency. METHODS: From a hospital clinic population, probands with probable XLRP and XLCORD were screened for RPGR ORF15 mutations and fully phenotyped. RESULTS: Four different RPGR ORF15 mutations were found in four probands. All mutations in the ORF15 exon resulted in premature truncation of the RPGR protein. Three were nonsense mutations: c.507G>T (p.E169stop), c.867G>T (p.G289stop), c.897G>T (p.E299stop) and the fourth a single nucleotide insertion c.1558-1559insA (p.S522fs 525stop). One family exhibited typical XLRP, two XLCORD and one a combination of the phenotypes. CONCLUSION: RPGR ORF15 mutations produce intrafamilial and interfamilial clinical variability with varying degrees of cone degeneration. In an Australian clinic population RPGR ORF15 mutations cause XLCORD in addition to XLRP.

19223935|t|Novel promoter and exon mutations of the BMPR2 gene in Chinese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
19223935|a|Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is clinically characterized by a sustained elevation in mean pulmonary artery pressure leading to significant morbidity and mortality, is caused by intense remodeling of small pulmonary arteries by endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation. Genetic studies in familial PAH (FPAH) have revealed heterozygous germline mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2), a receptor for the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/BMP superfamily. In this study, we conducted mutation screening in the promoter region and the entire coding regions as well as the intron/exon boundaries of the BMPR2 gene in 20 Chinese patients with either idiopathic or FPAH. All novel detected mutations were excluded by their presence in a panel of 200 chromosomes from normal individuals. A novel mutation, G-669A, in the promoter sequence of the BMPR2 gene was identified in one patient with FPAH, and no exonic mutations were detected in the proband. This mutation abolished a potential specificity protein 3 (sp3) transcription factor-binding site, and a dual luciferase assay showed that the promoter carrying the -669A allele had significantly decreased transcriptional activity compared with -669G allele. Of the other 19 patients, three novel heterozygous exonic mutations were identified: a frame shift mutation with deletion of TG at the nucleotide position 608-609 in exon 5 (Leu203fsX15), a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 292 in exon 3 (Glu98X) and a missense single nucleotide substitution in exon 12 (Ser863Asn).

19067809|t|Hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability during a tilt test in relation to gene polymorphism of renin-angiotensin and serotonin system.
19067809|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the renin-angiotensin system and serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms in relation to hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability during a head-up tilt test (HUT) in patients with vasovagal syncope. METHODS: DNA was collected from 191 patients (mean age 44+/-18 years, 61 men, 130 women). The following gene polymorphisms were determined in genomic DNA: angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism (I/D ACE), angiotensinogen gene polymorphism (M 235), angiotensin II receptor type 1 (ATR1) polymorphism (A 11666C), and polymorphism of serotonin transporter gene (5HTTLPR).Heart rate variability during HUT was assessed in 5-minute intervals by low frequency, high frequency, standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (SDNN), and root mean square successive difference parameters. RESULTS: AA genotype of A 1166C polymorphism was associated with lower minimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during HUT compared with other genotypes (minimal SBP: AA 59.6+/-21,8, AC 79.9+/-22.7, CC 65.4+/-22.7 mmHg, P=0.007), (minimal DBP: AA 36.4+/-22.7, AC 52.3+/-22.9, CC 45.4+/-19.5 mmHg, P=0.007).AA genotype was also associated with higher SDNN compared to other genotypes in the early phase of HUT (SDNN in 5 minutes of tilt: AA 59.7+/-24.6, AC 50.6+/-20.6, CC 46.0+/-13.2, P=0.01) and at syncope occurrence (SDNN: AA 71.0+/-20.9, AC 58.2+/-17.9, CC 58+/-10, P=0.04) CONCLUSION: AA genotype of A 1166C polymorphism in the ATR1 gene may be associated with hypotension and decline in sympathetic tone during HUT. Its role in genetic predisposition to vasovagal syncope cannot be excluded.

18945288|t|R58fs mutation in the HGD gene in a family with alkaptonuria in the UAE.
18945288|a|This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of alkaptonuria in the UAE population and to identify the genotype of affected individuals. In a 3 stage sampling technique 2981 pupils from Government schools in Al Ain and private schools in Dubai were selected to take part in the study, of whom 2857 provided urine samples. Urine collected was analysed for homogentisic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was isolated from the white blood cells of all family members of the affected case following standard established protocols. Specific PRC primers were designed to amplify all 14 exons of the HGD gene with the flanking intronic sequences including the splice site sequences. 2857 children returned a viable urine sample, of which one was highly positive for homogentisic acid. All 12 members of this girl's family were studied and one, a 22 year old brother, was found to excrete HGA. Another, a sister who had not provided a urine sample, was discovered by genetic testing. There were no complaints of joint pain or other symptoms in any member of this family. Parents were first cousins. We found a single nucleotide deletion c.342delA, located in exon 3, which resulted in a frameshift at amino acid position 58 (p.Arg58fs or p.R58fs). Alkaptonuria may be more common than it is thought to be with an allele prevalence estimated at 0.0107 (95% CI 0.000392-0.03473). The R58fs mutation is old, perhaps having occurred several thousand years ago, and has spread over a large geographical area.

18694509|t|Association of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion with clinical characteristics and outcomes: results from a population-based study of prostate cancer.
18694509|a|BACKGROUND: The presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene in prostate tumors has recently been associated with an aggressive phenotype, as well as recurrence and death from prostate cancer. These associations suggest the hypothesis that the gene fusion may be used as a prognostic indicator for prostate cancer. METHODS: In this study, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were used to assess TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status in a group of 214 prostate cancer cases from two population-based studies. The FISH assays were designed to detect both fusion type (deletion vs. translocation) and the number of fusion copies (single vs. multiple). Genotyping of four ERG and one TMPRSS2 SNPs using germline DNA was also performed in a sample of the cases (n = 127). RESULTS: Of the 214 tumors scored for the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, 64.5% were negative and 35.5% were positive for the fusion. Cases with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion did not exhibit reduced prostate cancer survival (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.22-3.93), nor was there a significant difference in cause-specific survival when stratifying by translocation or deletion (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.23-3.12) or by the number of retained fusion copies (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.45-3.34). However, evidence for reduced prostate cancer-specific survival was apparent in those cases whose tumor had multiple copies of the fusion. The variant T allele of the TMPRSS2 SNP, rs12329760, was positively associated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion by translocation (p = 0.05) and with multiple copies of the gene fusion (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: If replicated, the results presented here may provide insight into the mechanism by which the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion arises and also contribute to diagnostic evaluations for determining the subset of men who will go on to develop metastatic prostate cancer.

18672102|t|GATA4 mutations in 486 Chinese patients with congenital heart disease.
18672102|a|Recent studies have reported germline mutations in GATA4 gene in some types of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, the prevalence of GATA4 mutations in CHD and the correlation between the GATA4 genotype and CHD phenotype have not been extensively studied. We screened germline mutations in the coding exons and the flanking intron sequences of the GATA4 gene in 486 CHD patients by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and confirmed the mutations by sequencing. Nine distinct mutations including one small deletion mutation (46delS), two small insertion mutations (118-119insA and 125-126insAA), and six non-synonymous mutations (A6V, P163S, E359K, P407Q, S429T and A442V) were identified in 12 of the 486 patients (nine with ventricular septal defect, two with Tetralogy of Fallot, and one with endocardial cushion defect). Of them, two patients carrying E359K mutation were from two generations in one family with ventricular septal defect (VSD). Interestingly, a nucleotide insertion of c.1146+25insA in exon 6 was detected in five VSD patients, but not in 486 normal healthy controls. Our findings are useful in understanding the prevalence of GATA4 mutations and the correlation between the GATA4 genotype and the CHD phenotype in Chinese patients.

18606230|t|Premature stop codons in a facilitating EF-hand splice variant of CaV2.1 cause episodic ataxia type 2.
18606230|a|Premature stop codons in CACNA1A, which encodes the alpha(1A) subunit of neuronal P/Q-type (Ca(V)2.1) Ca(2+) channels, cause episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2). CACNA1A undergoes extensive alternative splicing, which contributes to the pharmacological and kinetic heterogeneity of Ca(V)2.1-mediated Ca(2+) currents. We identified three novel heterozygous stop codon mutations associated with EA2 in an alternately spliced exon (37A), which encodes part of an EF-hand motif required for Ca(2+)-dependent facilitation. One family had a C to G transversion (Y1854X). A dinucleotide deletion results in the same premature stop codon in a second family, and a further single nucleotide change leads to a different truncation (R1858X) in a de novo case of EA2. Expression studies of the Y1854X mutation revealed loss of Ca(V)2.1-mediated current. Because these mutations do not affect the alternate exon 37B, these findings reveal unexpected dependence of cerebellar function on intact exon 37A-containing Ca(V)2.1 channels.

18492086|t|Variable phenotypic expression of homozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia due to novel APOB gene mutations.
18492086|a|Homozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia (Ho-FHBL) is a rare co-dominant disorder characterized by extremely low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Most patients with Ho-FHBL have mutations in APOB gene resulting in truncated apoBs. Some patients are asymptomatic, while others have fatty liver, intestinal fat malabsorption and neurological dysfunctions. We investigated three adult subjects with severe hypobetalipoproteinaemia and a family history of FHBL. Proband FHBL-47 had liver cirrhosis with hepatocarcinoma and a renal carcinoma but no clinical manifestations related to FHBL. He was a compound heterozygote for a 7-bp deletion in exon 21 and a base insertion in exon 26 resulting in truncated apoBs (apoB-22.46/apoB-66.51). Proband FHBL-53, with severe hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, had a nonsense mutation in exon 19 resulting in a truncated apoB (apoB-20.61) and a rare nucleotide substitution in intron 14 (c.2068-4T>A). The latter was also present in her daughter, found to have low plasma LDL-C and apoB. Proband FHBL-82 had chronic diarrhoea and steatorrhoea. She was found to be homozygous for a nonsense mutation in exon 24 resulting in a truncated apoB (apoB-26.65). In adult subjects, the presence of chronic liver disease and chronic diarrhoea, when associated with severe hypobetalipoproteinaemia, may lead to the diagnosis of Ho-FHBL.

18397285|t|L1503R is a member of group I mutation and has dominant-negative effect on secretion of full-length VWF multimers: an analysis of two patients with type 2A von Willebrand disease.
18397285|a|Type 2A von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by decreased platelet-dependent function of von Willebrand factor (VWF); this in turn is associated with an absence of high-molecular-weight multimers. Sequence analysis of the VWF gene from two unrelated type 2A VWD patients showed an identical, novel, heterozygous T-->G transversion at nucleotide 4508, resulting in the substitution of L1503R in the VWF A2 domain. This substitution, which was not found in 60 unrelated normal individuals, was introduced into a full-length VWF cDNA and subsequently expressed in 293T cells. Only trace amount of the mutant VWF protein was secreted but most of the same was retained in 293T cells. Co-transfection experiment of both wild-type and mutant plasmids indicated the dominant-negative mechanism of disease development; as more of mutant DNA was transfected, VWF secretion was impaired in the media, whereas more of VWF was stored in the cell lysates. Molecular dynamic simulations of structural changes induced by L1503R indicated that the mean value of all-atom root-mean-squared-deviation was shifted from those with wild type or another mutation L1503Q that has been reported to be a group II mutation, which is susceptible to ADAMTS13 proteolysis. Protein instability of L1503R may be responsible for its intracellular retention and perhaps the larger VWF multimers, containing more mutant VWF subunits, are likely to be mal-processed and retained within the cell.

18372165|t|Molecular and clinical characterization in Japanese and Korean patients with Hailey-Hailey disease: six new mutations in the ATP2C1 gene.
18372165|a|BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant disorder Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD) results from mutations in the ATP2C1 gene, which encodes the human secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+ -ATPase protein 1. To date, over 90 pathological mutations scattered throughout ATP2C1 have been described with no indication of mutational hotspots or clustering of mutations. No paradigm for genotype-phenotype correlation has emerged. OBJECTIVES: To determine the pathogenic ATP2C1 abnormality in additional patients with HHD in order to provide further contributions to the understanding of the molecular basis of this disorder and to add the data to the known mutation database. METHODS: In this study, we investigated eight unrelated Japanese and Korean patients with HHD. We performed direct nucleotide sequencing of the ATP2C1 gene in all patients and RT-PCR analysis, using RNA extracted from a skin biopsy, in a patient with the mildest clinical features. RESULTS: We identified seven different heterozygous mutations in seven of the eight investigated patients, including three new single nucleotide deletion/duplication mutations: c.520delC; c.681dupA; c.956delC, three new donor splice site mutations: c.360+1G>C; c.899+1G>T; c.1570+2T>C, as well as a previously described nonsense mutation: p.Arg153X. RT-PCR analysis in the mildest affected patient with a heterozygous c.360+1G>C mutation, demonstrated expression of a short in-frame mutant transcript with exon 5 skipping, which may account for the mild phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The results expand the known mutation spectrum in HHD and show the importance of RNA analysis for understanding the genotype-phenotype correlations more precisely.

18189233|t|RNASEL and RNASEL-inhibitor variation and prostate cancer risk in Afro-Caribbeans.
18189233|a|BACKGROUND: Afro-Caribbeans from Tobago are at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This elevated risk of prostate cancer is shared by populations of African ancestry living in diverse environments in the Western hemisphere. Variation in the ribonuclease L (RNASEL) gene has recently been reported to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. However, whether RNASEL variation contributes to the increased risk of prostate cancer observed in populations of African ancestry remains unclear. METHODS: We resequenced the positional candidate gene RNASEL in 48 prostate cancer cases and genotyped the previously reported R462Q and D541E polymorphisms in 230 prostate cancer cases and 458 controls. We also examined the inhibitor of RNASEL (ABCE1) for variation associated with prostate cancer risk. RESULTS: We found no evidence of association between R462Q and D541E polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in our case/control analysis. A novel variant (K294E) was identified in a single heterozygous individual with prostate cancer. We also observed a 20 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism 1,109 bp upstream of the initiation codon, but this variant was not associated with prostate cancer. We identified 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCE1 gene, only 3 of which had a minor allele frequency >5%. A common A/G transition -1,071 bp from the transcriptional start site was genotyped and showed no evidence of association with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that common variation in the putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene, RNASEL, or its inhibitor does not contribute significantly to prostate cancer risk in this Afro-Caribbean population.

18166824|t|Genetic investigation of four meiotic genes in women with premature ovarian failure.
18166824|a|OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether mutations of meiotic genes, such as disrupted meiotic cDNA (DMC1), MutS homolog (MSH4), MSH5, and S. cerevisiae homolog (SPO11), were associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Blood sampling, karyotype, hormonal dosage, ultrasound, and ovarian biopsy were carried out on most patients. However, the main outcome measure was the sequencing of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples of 41 women with POF and 36 fertile women (controls). RESULTS: A single heterozygous missense mutation, substitution of a cytosine residue with thymidine in exon 2 of MSH5, was found in two Caucasian women in whom POF developed at 18 and 36 years of age. This mutation resulted in replacement of a non-polar amino acid (proline) with a polar amino acid (serine) at position 29 (P29S). Neither 36 control women nor 39 other patients with POF possessed this genetic perturbation. Another POF patient of African origin showed a homozygous nucleotide change in the tenth of DMC1 gene that led to an alteration of the amino acid composition of the protein (M200V). CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of infertility observed in the DMC1 homozygote mutation carrier and in both patients with a heterozygous substitution in exon 2 of the MSH5 gene provide indirect evidence of the role of genes involved in meiotic recombination in the regulation of ovarian function. MSH5 and DMC1 mutations may be one explanation for POF, albeit uncommon.

19276632|t|Mutation analysis of FOXF2 in patients with disorders of sex development (DSD) in combination with cleft palate.
19276632|a|In contrast to disorders of sexual differentiation caused by lack of androgen production or inhibited androgen action, defects affecting development of the bipotent genital anlagen have rarely been investigated in humans. We have previously documented that the transcription factor FOXF2 is highly expressed in human foreskin. Moreover, Foxf2 knockout mice present with cleft palate in combination with hypoplasia of the genital tubercle. We hypothesized that humans with disorders of sex development (DSD) in combination with cleft palate could have mutations in the FOXF2 gene. Eighteen children with DSD and cleft palate were identified in the L  beck DSD database (about 1,500 entries). Genomic DNA sequence analysis of the FOXF2 gene was performed and compared with 10 normal female and 10 normal male controls, respectively. Two heterozygous DNA sequence variations were solely present in one single patient each but in none of the 20 normal controls: a duplication of GCC (c.97GCC[9]+[10]) resulting in an extra alanine within exon 1 and a 25*G>A substitution in the 3'-untranslated region. Two patients carried a c.262G>A sequence variation predicting for an Ala88Thr exchange which was also detected in 2 normal controls. Two silent mutations, c.1272C>T (Ser424Ser) and c.1284T>C (Tyr428Tyr), respectively, occurred in the coding region of exon 2, again in both patients and normal controls. In conclusion, the majority of the detected sequence alterations were polymorphisms without obvious functional relevance. However, it cannot be excluded that the 2 unique DNA sequence alterations could have affected FOXF2 on the mRNA or protein level thus contributing to the observed disturbances in genital and palate development.

17968299|t|Analysis of -1082 IL-10 gene polymorphism in Iranian patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
17968299|a|BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease and its severe forms, such as aggressive periodontitis, are suggested to have a genetic basis. Among the genetic factors, polymorphisms in cytokine genes have recently been described in susceptibility to periodontitis. IL-10 is a multi-functional cytokine thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. A substitution G/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene at position -1082 has been associated with different amounts of IL-10 production. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible links between -1082(G/A) polymorphism of the IL-10 gene and the generalized form of aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: This study included 52 Iranian Khorasanian (north-east province of Iran) subjects suffering from generalized aggressive periodontitis referred to the Periodontology Department of Mashhad Dental School. They were compared to 61 age and sex-matched healthy controls of the same race. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells and genotyping was performed by means of the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared test. RESULTS: There was no marked difference in genotype frequencies between the controls and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients (p=0.585). Moreover, no association between patients and normal subjects was found in their allele frequency (p=0.329). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the polymorphic nucleotide A at position -1082 of the IL-10 gene is not associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis in the Iranian population.

17961316|t|In vitro expression of beta-thalassaemia gene (IVS1-1G>C) reveals complete inactivation of the normal 5' splice site and alternative aberrant RNA splicing.
17961316|a|We previously reported a case of heterozygous beta-thalassaemia with IVS1-1G > C substitution in the beta-globin gene and a non-detectable level of mutant mRNA in the patient's reticulocytes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the transcription and RNA splicing and processing of the mutant gene occurred. We analysed the expression of the mRNA encoded by the cloned mutant gene in COS-1 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleotide sequencing. The G > C mutation completely inactivated the normal 5' splice site and resulted in the activation of two cryptic 5' splice sites, located 16 and 38 nt upstream of the normal site. The usage of these two cryptic sites accords with the findings of reports on IVS1-1G > A or IVS1-1G > C substitution of exon 1 of the beta-globin gene. Additional experiments that involved transfection of equal amounts of both normal and mutant vectors into COS-1 cells indicated the presence of mutant mRNAs. In conclusion, the beta-thalassaemia gene (IVS1-1G > C) was expressed in transfected cells, but showed aberrant RNA splicing. Further studies will be required to clarify the molecular mechanism that results in severe reduction in the mutant mRNA level in vivo.

17935240|t|Somatic and gonadal mosaicism in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.
17935240|a|The g.ORF15 + 652-653delAG mutation in the RPGR gene is the most frequent mutation in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of mosaicism in an XLRP family. Eight subjects in the RP family were recruited. Blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. Haplotype analysis and mutational screening on the RPGR gene were performed. Additionally, samples of hair follicles and buccal cells from the mother of the proband were acquired for DNA extraction and molecular analysis. Phenotype was characterized with routine ophthalmic examination, Goldmann perimetry, electroretinography, and color fundus photography. A g.ORF15 + 652-653delAG mutation was identified in second- and third-generation patients/carriers. A first-generation female, who was considered to be an obligate carrier, demonstrated a normal phenotype as well as a normal genotype in lymphocytic DNA, indicating the gonadal mosaicism; however, a heterozygous AG-deletion at nucleotide 652 and 653 was identified in the genomic DNA of hair follicles, hair shaft, and buccal cells, indicating that the mutation is somatic. In conclusion, we reported on a family in which an asymptomatic woman with somatic-gonadal mosaicism for a RPGR gene mutation transmitted the mutation to an asymptomatic daughter and to a son with XLRP. Gonadal mosaicism may be responsible for a proportion of multiplex or simplex RP families, in which more than 50% of all cases of RP are found. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

17909797|t|Impact of the CCR5 gene polymorphism on the survival of metastatic melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy.
17909797|a|PURPOSE: Chemokines influence both tumor progression and anti-tumor immune response. A 32-bp-deletion polymorphism in the chemokine receptor 5 gene (CCR5Delta32) has been shown to result in a non-functional protein. This study was aimed at evaluating the potential impact of this gene polymorphism on disease progression and treatment outcome in patients with melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCR5 genotyping was performed by PCR on DNA extracted from serum samples of 782 cutaneous melanoma patients with known disease history and long-term clinical follow-up. Genotypes were correlated with patient survival and types of treatment. RESULTS: Of 782 melanoma patients, 90 (11.5%) were heterozygous and 12 (1.5%) were homozygous for CCR5Delta32. Analyzing the complete cohort, the disease-specific survival from date of primary diagnosis was not influenced by CCR5 status. Similarly, no significant impact could be detected on the treatment outcome of stage III patients. In 139 stage IV patients receiving immunotherapy, CCR5Delta32 was associated with a decreased survival compared to patients not carrying the deletion (median 12.5 vs. 20.3 months, P = 0.029). Multivariate analysis revealed the CCR5 genotype as an independent factor impacting disease-specific survival in this patient population (P = 0.002), followed by gender (P = 0.019) and pathological classification of the primary (pT; P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: The presence of the CCR5Delta32 polymorphism in patients with stage IV melanoma results in a decreased survival following immunotherapy and may help to select patients less likely to benefit from this type of treatment.

17395743|t|Identification of PVT1 as a candidate gene for end-stage renal disease in type 2 diabetes using a pooling-based genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism association study.
17395743|a|To identify genetic variants contributing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, we performed a genome-wide analysis of 115,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pools of 105 unrelated case subjects with ESRD and 102 unrelated control subjects who have had type 2 diabetes for > or =10 years without macroalbuminuria. Using a sliding window statistic of ranked SNPs, we identified a 200-kb region on 8q24 harboring three SNPs showing substantial differences in allelic frequency between case and control pools. These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence for association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96]), which is located in the plasmacytoma variant translocation gene PVT1. We sequenced all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter of PVT1 and identified 47 variants, 11 of which represented nonredundant markers with minor allele frequency > or =0.05. We subsequently genotyped these 11 variants and an additional 87 SNPs identified through public databases in 319-kb flanking rs2720709 ( approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with ESRD at P < 0.01. The strongest evidence for association was found for rs2648875 (P = 0.0000018; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which maps to intron 8 of PVT1. Together, these results suggest that PVT1 may contribute to ESRD susceptibility in diabetes.

17391797|t|The phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene V175M single nucleotide polymorphism confers the susceptibility to NASH in Japanese population.
17391797|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The genetic predisposition on the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been poorly understood. A functional polymorphism Val175Met was reported in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the carriers of Val175Met variant impaired in PEMT activity are more susceptible to NASH. METHODS: Blood samples of 107 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and of 150 healthy volunteers were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Val175Met variant allele of the PEMT gene was significantly more frequent in NASH patients than in healthy volunteers (p<0.001), and carriers of Val175Met variant were significantly more frequent in NASH patients than in healthy volunteers (p<0.01). Among NASH patients, body mass index was significantly lower (p<0.05), and non-obese patients were significantly more frequent (p<0.001) in carriers of Val175Met variant than in homozygotes of wild type PEMT. CONCLUSIONS: Val175Met variant of PEMT could be a candidate molecule that determines the susceptibility to NASH, because it is more frequently observed in NASH patients and non-obese persons with Val175Met variant of PEMT are facilitated to develop NASH.

17292585|t|Semi-automated, reverse-hybridization detection of multiple mutations causing hereditary fructose intolerance.
17292585|a|Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a potentially fatal nutritional disease that is caused by mutations in the liver isoenzyme of fructoaldolase (aldolase B). Our aim was to evaluate a diagnostic assay capable of simultaneously analyzing three-point mutations and a small deletion in the aldolase B (ALDOB) gene. The test under investigation is based on multiplex DNA amplification and hybridization to membrane strips presenting a parallel array of allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. We used the novel reverse-hybridization (RH) protocol to analyze 54 individuals previously genotyped by direct sequencing. RH genotyping for ALDOB mutations Delta4E4, A149P, A174D, and N334K was in complete concordance with results obtained by DNA sequencing. The procedure is rapid (<6h) and may be automated to a large extent. The RH assay tested in this study represents an accurate and robust screening tool to identify common ALDOB mutations.

17166870|t|Association between an endoglin gene polymorphism and systemic sclerosis-related pulmonary arterial hypertension.
17166870|a|Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by early generalized microangiopathy with disturbed angiogenesis. Endoglin gene (ENG) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein which acts as an accessory receptor for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, and is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity. A 6-base insertion in intron 7 (6bINS) of ENG has been reported to be associated with microvascular disturbance. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between 6bINS and the vascular complication pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc in a French Caucasian population. METHODS: Two hundred eighty SSc cases containing 29/280 having PAH diagnosed by catheterism were compared with 140 patients with osteoarthritis. Genotyping was performed by polymerase-chain-reaction-based fluorescence and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RESULTS: The polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We observed a significant lower frequency of 6bINS allele in SSc patients with associated PAH compared with controls [10.3 vs 23.9%, P = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.89], and a trend in comparison with SSc patients without PAH (10.3 vs 20.3%, P = 0.05; OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.19-1.08). Genotypes carrying allele 6bINS were also less frequent in SSc patients with PAH than in controls (20.7 vs 42.9%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Thus the frequency of 6bINS differs between SSc patients with or without PAH, suggesting the implication of ENG in this devastating vascular complication of SSc.

17079875|t|Putative association of RUNX1 polymorphisms with IgE levels in a Korean population.
17079875|a|RUNX1, a member of the runt domain gene family of transcription factors, encodes a heterodimeric transcription factor and regulates the expression of various genes related to hematopoiesis and myeloid differentiation. RUNX1 has been one of the target genes for research into various autoimmune diseases due to its properties as a transcription factor and functional distribution for chromosomal translocation. In an effort to identify additional gene polymorphisms in which variants have been implicated in asthma, we investigated the genetic polymorphisms in RUNX1 to evaluate it as a potential candidate gene for a host genetic study of asthma and IgE production. We identified 19 sequence variants by direct DNA sequencing in 24 individuals of which four common variants were selected for genotyping in our asthma cohort (1,055 asthmatic patients, 384 normal controls). Using logistic regression analysis for association with the risk of asthma, while controlling for age, gender, and smoking status as covariates, no significant associations with the risk of asthma were detected. However, two polymorphisms in the promoter region (-2084G>C and -1282G>A) showed a marginal association with total IgE levels (0.03 and 0.03 in recessive models, respectively). Our findings suggest that polymorphisms in RUNX1 might be one of the genetic factors for the regulation of IgE production.

17059986|t|A novel splicing mutation in SLC12A3 associated with Gitelman syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
17059986|a|We report a case of Gitelman syndrome (GS) in a dizygotic twin who presented at 12 years of age with growth delay, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia with inappropriate kaliuresis, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension with bilateral papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri). The patient, her twin sister, and her mother also presented with cerebral cavernous malformations. Based on the early onset and normocalciuria, Bartter syndrome was diagnosed first. However, mutation analysis showed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in SLC12A3: a substitution of serine by leucine at amino acid position 555 (p.Ser555Leu) and a novel guanine to cytosine transition at the 5' splice site of intron 22 (c.2633+1G>C), providing the molecular diagnosis of GS. These mutations were not detected in 200 normal chromosomes and cosegregated within the family. Analysis of complementary DNA showed that the heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G>C caused the appearance of 2 RNA molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 (r.2521_2634del). Supplementation with potassium and magnesium improved clinical symptoms and resulted in catch-up growth, but vision remained impaired. Three similar associations of Bartter syndrome/GS with pseudotumor cerebri were found in the literature, suggesting that electrolyte abnormalities and secondary aldosteronism may have a role in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This study provides further evidence for the phenotypical heterogeneity of GS and its association with severe manifestations in children. It also shows the independent segregation of familial cavernomatosis and GS.

17033974|t|Mutation in the auxiliary calcium-channel subunit CACNA2D4 causes autosomal recessive cone dystrophy.
17033974|a|Retinal signal transmission depends on the activity of high voltage-gated l-type calcium channels in photoreceptor ribbon synapses. We recently identified a truncating frameshift mutation in the Cacna2d4 gene in a spontaneous mouse mutant with profound loss of retinal signaling and an abnormal morphology of ribbon synapses in rods and cones. The Cacna2d4 gene encodes an l-type calcium-channel auxiliary subunit of the alpha (2) delta type. Mutations in its human orthologue, CACNA2D4, were not yet known to be associated with a disease. We performed mutation analyses of 34 patients who received an initial diagnosis of night blindness, and, in two affected siblings, we detected a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.2406C-->A) in CACNA2D4. The mutation introduces a premature stop codon that truncates one-third of the corresponding open reading frame. Both patients share symptoms of slowly progressing cone dystrophy. These findings represent the first report of a mutation in the human CACNA2D4 gene and define a novel gene defect that causes autosomal recessive cone dystrophy.

17003357|t|A haplotype-based analysis of the PTPN22 locus in type 1 diabetes.
17003357|a|A recent addition to the list of widely confirmed type 1 diabetes risk loci is the PTPN22 gene encoding a lymphoid-specific phosphatase (Lyp). However, evidence supporting a role for PTPN22 in type 1 diabetes derives entirely from the study of just one coding single nucleotide polymorphism, 1858C/T. In the current study, the haplotype structure of the PTPN22 region was determined, and individual haplotypes were tested for association with type 1 diabetes in family-based tests. The 1858T risk allele occurred on only a single haplotype that was strongly associated with type 1 diabetes (P = 7.9 x 10(-5)). After controlling for the effects of this allele, two other haplotypes were observed to be weakly associated with type 1 diabetes (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the coding region of PTPN22 on these haplotypes revealed a novel variant (2250G/C) predicted to result in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution. Analysis of PTPN22 transcripts from a subject heterozygous for this variant indicated that it interfered with normal mRNA splicing, resulting in a premature termination codon after exon 17. These results support the conclusion that the 1858C/T allele is the major risk variant for type 1 diabetes in the PTPN22 locus, but they suggest that additional infrequent coding variants at PTPN22 may also contribute to type 1 diabetes risk.

16728705|t|Association of TNF haplotypes with asthma, serum IgE levels, and correlation with serum TNF-alpha levels.
16728705|a|Both biochemical and genetic evidence have implicated the genes for TNF-alpha (TNFA) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) in atopic asthma. Here, we report for the first time the association of their genotypes and haplotypes with atopic asthma in Indian populations. We genotyped seven single nucleotide polymorphisms, encompassing the two genes, in patients and control subjects in two independent cohorts. Serum TNF-alpha levels of selected individuals were measured and correlated with genotypes and haplotypes. The A allele of the TNFA-863C > A polymorphism was associated with reduced risk of asthma (P = 0.002 and 0.007 in Cohorts A and B, respectively), reduced TsIgE levels (P = 0.0024 and P = 0.0029 in Cohorts A and B, respectively), and reduced serum TNF-alpha levels (P < 0.05). A marginal association was also observed for LTA_NcoI polymorphism with asthma and TsIgE levels. Furthermore, analysis using HAPLO. STATS showed significant differences in the major haplotype frequencies (> 3%) between patients and control subjects (P = 0.002 and P = 0.006 for Cohorts A and B, respectively). Individually, the haplotype GATCCG was the most frequent in patients (P = 0.0029 and P = 0.0025 for Cohorts A and B, respectively), and was associated with high TsIgE and serum TNF-alpha levels, whereas AACACG was the most frequent in the control subjects (P = 0.0032 and P = 0.022 for Cohorts A and B, respectively), and was associated with low TsIgE and serum TNF-alpha levels. We also report here that the C > A substitution at position -863 of the TNFA influences the binding of nuclear proteins in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments. Thus, the TNFA-863C > A polymorphism in the promoter region of TNFA may influence TNF-alpha expression and affect TsIgE levels and susceptibility to asthma.

16644711|t|A functional Tyr1306Cys variant in LARG is associated with increased insulin action in vivo.
16644711|a|Diminished insulin sensitivity is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of insulin action, resulting in reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake, is mediated in part through stimulation of RhoA activity. One regulator of RhoA activity is leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG). The LARG gene maps to a region on chromosome 11q23-24 that shows genetic linkage to BMI and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians. Because of its role in RhoA activation, the LARG gene was analyzed as a positional candidate gene for this linkage. Sequencing of the LARG gene and genotyping of variants identified several polymorphisms that were associated with in vivo rates of insulin-mediated glucose uptake, at both physiological and maximally stimulating insulin concentrations, among 322 nondiabetic Pima Indians who had undergone a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The strongest association with rate of glucose uptake was found with a Tyr1306Cys polymorphism (P < 0.0001, adjusted for age, sex, percent body fat, and nuclear family membership). In transient transfection studies in NIH3T3 cells, the LARG(Cys1306) protein had reduced activity compared with LARG(Tyr1306) protein (P < 0.05). We propose that the Tyr1306Cys substitution in LARG, through its differential activation of RhoA, increases insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Pima Indians.

16543197|t|A G1103R mutation in CRB1 is co-inherited with high hyperopia and Leber congenital amaurosis.
16543197|a|PURPOSE: To identify the genetic basis of recessive inheritance of high hyperopia and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) in a family of Middle Eastern origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were examined using standard ophthalmic techniques. DNA samples were obtained and genetic linkage was carried out using polymorphic markers flanking the known genes and loci for LCA. Exons were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: All four members of this family affected by LCA showed high to extreme hyperopia, with average spherical refractive errors ranging from +5.00 to +10.00. Linkage was obtained to 1q31.3 with a maximal LOD score of 5.20 and a mutation found in exon 9 of the CRB1 gene, causing a G1103R substitution at a highly conserved site in the protein. CRB1 is a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila crumbs gene, which is required for photoreceptor morphogenesis, and has been associated with either retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or LCA. This sequence variant has previously been reported as a compound heterozygote in one sporadic LCA patient. CONCLUSION: Although hyperopia has been associated with LCA, it is typically moderate and variable between patients with the same mutation. In addition, some CRB1 mutations can be associated with either RP or LCA. We have shown that hyperopia and LCA are linked to the mutant CRB1 gene itself and are not dependent on unlinked modifiers.

16525586|t|Mutations in coagulation factor XIII A gene in eight unrelated Indians. Five novel mutations identified by a novel PCR-CSGE approach.
16525586|a|Factor XIII deficiency is a rare autosomal (1:2,000,000) recessive disorder of blood coagulation usually attributed to mutations in the coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) A gene. We have studied the molecular basis of FXIII deficiency in eight unrelated South Indian patients. Their diagnosis was based on clinical history, normal plasma clotting times and increased solubility of fibrin clot in 5 mol/l urea. Genomic DNA was screened for FXIII A gene defects by a novel PCR and CSGE strategy. Mutations were identified in all these patients. Five of these were novel mutations occurring in four patients. These included a novel c.210T > G transversion in homozygosity in exon 3 predicting a Tyr69X in the beta-sandwich domain in one patient. Another patient was compound heterozygote for a novel c.791C > T transition predicting a Ser263Phe in the core domain and a novel c.2045-1G > A transition at the acceptor splice junction of intron 14. Two novel frame shifts were also identified in two patients in a homozygous condition. One of them resulted from a single base 'G' duplication (c.892_895dupG) at codons Ser290/Ala291fs affecting the core domain and the other was due to a single base 'A' duplication (c.1642_1644dupA) and at codonTyr547fs affecting barrel-1 domain. The remaining four patients had the previously reported Arg260His, Ser413Leu, and Val414Phe (n = 2) missense mutations in the core domain. The novel mutations identified were considered to be disease causative by studying the nature of mutation, the degree of conservation of the mutated aminoacid among transglutaminases of different species and by molecular modeling. Apart from describing a significant number of novel mutations, this report is the first study from Southern India to describe FXIII A gene mutations.

16256386|t|Phenylketonuria mutations in Northern China.
16256386|a|Mutation spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Northern China is described with a discussion on genotype-phenotype correlation. By using PCR/SSCP and DNA sequencing, all exons of PAH gene in the 185 unrelated patients with PKU from Northern China were studied. A total of 70 different mutations, including 42 missense, 12 splice, 7 nonsense, 5 deletion, 3 insertion, and 1 silence/splice mutations, were detected in 349/370 mutant alleles (94.3%). Deletion, insertion, and frameshift mutations were found for the first time in China PKU patients. The mutations R243Q, EX6-96A>G, R111X, Y356X, and R413P were the prevalent mutations with relative frequencies of 22.2, 11.1, 8.7, 6.5, and 6.5%, respectively. Fifteen novel mutations were identified in this study: I38fsX19, IVS4+3G>C, Y154H, R157K, R157I, T200fsX6, Q267H, Q267E, F302fsX39, G346R, S349A, L367L, R400K, IVS12+4A>G, and IVS12+6T>A. Each of them occurs at very low frequency (0.3-1.1%). The mutation spectrum of PKU in Chinese is similar to other Asian populations but significantly different from European populations. Altogether, 70 different mutations are found in 109 genotypes distributed among 185 PKU patients. As shown by the analysis, the predicted residual activity found in the majority of PKU individuals match their in vivo phenotypes, though evidence is also found for both phenotypic inconsistencies among subjects with similar genotypes and discordance between the in vitro and in vivo effects of some mutant alleles. The study enables us to construct a national database in China serving as a valuable tool for genetic counseling and prognostic evaluation of future cases of PKU.

16252083|t|Polymorphisms of the DNA mismatch repair gene HMSH2 in breast cancer occurence and progression.
16252083|a|The response of the cell to DNA damage and its ability to maintain genomic stability by DNA repair are crucial in preventing cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, polymorphism of DNA repair genes may affect the process of carcinogenesis. The importance of genetic variability of the components of mismatch repair (MMR) genes is well documented in colorectal cancer, but little is known about its role in breast cancer. hMSH2 is one of the crucial proteins of MMR. We performed a case-control study to test the association between two polymorphisms in the hMSH2 gene: an A --> G transition at 127 position producing an Asn --> Ser substitution at codon 127 (the Asn127Ser polymorphism) and a G --> A transition at 1032 position resulting in a Gly --> Asp change at codon 322 (the Gly322Asp polymorphism) and breast cancer risk and cancer progression. Genotypes were determined in DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 150 breast cancer patients and 150 age-matched women (controls) by restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific PCR. We did not observe any correlation between studied polymorphisms and breast cancer progression evaluated by node-metastasis, tumor size and Bloom-Richardson grading. A strong association between breast cancer occurrence and the Gly/Gly phenotype of the Gly322Asp polymorphism (odds ratio 8.39; 95% confidence interval 1.44-48.8) was found. Therefore, MMR may play a role in the breast carcinogenesis and the Gly322Asp polymorphism of the hMSH2 gene may be considered as a potential marker in breast cancer.

16186368|t|Characterization of Bietti crystalline dystrophy patients with CYP4V2 mutations.
16186368|a|PURPOSE: Mutations of the CYP4V2 gene, a novel family member of the cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 4q35, have recently been identified in patients with Bietti crystalline dystrophy (BCD). The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of mutations in this gene in BCD patients from Singapore, and to characterize their phenotype. METHODS: Nine patients with BCD from six families were recruited into the study. The 11 exons of the CYP4V2 gene were amplified from genomic DNA of patients by polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced. Detailed characterization of the patients' phenotype was performed with fundal photography, visual field testing, fundal fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography (ERG). RESULTS: Three pathogenic mutations were identified; two mutations, S482X and K386T, were novel and found in three patients. The third mutation, a previously identified 15-bp deletion that included the 3' splice site for exon 7, was found in all nine patients, with six patients carrying the deletion in the homozygous state. Haplotype analysis in patients and controls indicated a founder effect for this deletion mutation in exon 7. Clinical heterogeneity was present in the patients. Compound heterozygotes for the deletion in exon 7 seemed to have more severe disease compared to patients homozygous for the deletion. There was good correlation between clinical stage of disease and ERG changes, but age did not correlate with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel mutations in the CYP4V2 gene as a cause of BCD. A high carrier frequency for the 15-bp deletion in exon 7 may exist in the Singapore population. Phenotype characterization showed clinical heterogeneity, and age did not correlate with disease severity.

16181814|t|Mono-allelic POLG expression resulting from nonsense-mediated decay and alternative splicing in a patient with Alpers syndrome.
16181814|a|Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a progressive, fatal brain and liver disease. This syndrome has been associated with mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol gamma). Most patients with Alpers syndrome have been found to be compound heterozygotes, carrying two pathogenic mutations in trans at the POLG locus. POLG is a nuclear-encoded gene whose protein product is imported into mitochondria, where it is essential for mtDNA replication and repair. We studied the skin fibroblasts of a patient with Alpers syndrome having the genotype E873stop/A467T. The E873stop mutation produces a premature termination codon (TAG) in exon 17. The A467T mutation produces a threonine to alanine substitution at a highly conserved site in exon 7. The allele bearing the stop codon (E873-TAG) is predicted to produce a truncated, catalytically inactive polymerase. However, only full-length pol gamma protein was detected by Western blot analysis. Here, we show that transcripts containing this stop codon undergo nonsense-associated alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. More than 95% of the functional POLG mRNA was derived from the allele bearing the A467T mutation and less than 5% contained the E873stop mutation. These events ensured that virtually all POLG protein in the cell was expressed from the A467T allele. Therefore, the Alpers phenotype in this patient was a consequence of a single-copy gene dose of the A467T allele, and selective elimination of transcripts bearing the E873stop mutation.

16143638|t|Combinations of genetic changes in the human cAMP-responsive element modulator gene: a clue towards understanding some forms of male infertility?
16143638|a|The cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) gene plays a pivotal role in the mouse spermatogenesis, but its role in the human infertility has not been fully established. We performed a mutation screening in 13 Slovenian men with round spermatid arrest and in six controls. Eleven genetic changes have been identified in the human CREM gene, three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms [within the promoters P1, P3 and intervening sequence 1 (IVS1)], one insertion (IVS2) and one non-sense mutation (exon gamma). Some infertile patients seem to accumulate potentially harmful genetic changes. We identified a patient with no CREM immunoreactive protein that was homozygous for the nucleotide changes in all promoters, IVS 1, 2, 6, and was heterozygous for the mutation in exon gamma. Interestingly, insertion in IVS2 (IVS2-58_55insT) results in a four-fold decrease in binding of nuclear proteins. Computer predictions suggested the presence of a potential novel CREM promoter, however, random amplification of cDNA ends from the human testis cDNA library was not successful in confirming a novel transcription start site of the CREM gene. Screening of a larger number of patients and controls is required to elucidate whether the observed combinations of genetic changes in the CREM gene can explain some forms of male infertility.

16088915|t|Novel amino acid substitution in the Y-position of collagen type II causes spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia congenita.
16088915|a|We report on monozygotic twins with short stature and severe spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEMDC) from the Polish population. Phenotype of the twin girls resembles spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita Spranger-Wiedemann (SEDC-SW), but shortening of the stature is more severe and the cranioface is normal. The distinctive radiographic features, in spite of similarity to SEDC-SW, indicate different spinal and, notably, severe metaphyseal involvement. Molecular analysis of the COL2A1 gene revealed an A to G transition at nucleotide +79 of exon 41 that converted the codon for arginine at amino acid 792 to a codon for glycine (Arg792Gly). The twins were heterozygous for the mutation and neither parent had this change. The Arg792Gly substitution is located at the Y-position of Gly-X-Y triplet, and it is likely that this substitution decreased the thermal stability of the triple helix and may affect fibril growth by replacement of an arginine residue, which is important for a conformation of the triple helix.

16051693|t|Polymorphism of the PEMT gene and susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
16051693|a|Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes phosphatidylcholine synthesis. PEMT knockout mice have fatty livers, and it is possible that, in humans, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might be associated with PEMT gene polymorphisms. DNA samples from 59 humans without fatty liver and from 28 humans with NAFLD were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 8 of PEMT, which leads to a V175M substitution. V175M is a loss of function mutation, as determined by transiently transfecting McArdle-RH7777 cells with constructs of wild-type PEMT open reading frame or the V175M mutant. Met/Met at residue 175 (loss of function SNP) occurred in 67.9% of the NAFLD subjects and in only 40.7% of control subjects (P<0.03).

15983230|t|Polymorphisms in the SLC2A2 (GLUT2) gene are associated with the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes: the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.
15983230|a|Impaired insulin secretion is a fundamental defect in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes regulating insulin secretion (SLC2A2 [encoding GLUT2], GCK, TCF1 [encoding HNF-1alpha], HNF4A, GIP, and GLP1R) are associated with the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes in participants of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study. With the exception of SLC2A2, other genes were not associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. All four SNPs of SLC2A2 predicted the conversion to diabetes, and rs5393 (AA genotype) increased the risk of type 2 diabetes in the entire study population by threefold (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.34-6.88, P = 0.008). The risk for type 2 diabetes in the AA genotype carriers was increased in the control group (5.56 [1.78-17.39], P = 0.003) but not in the intervention group. We conclude that the SNPs of SLC2A2 predict the conversion to diabetes in obese subjects with IGT.

15880727|t|The spectrum of aldolase B (ALDOB) mutations and the prevalence of hereditary fructose intolerance in Central Europe.
15880727|a|We investigated the molecular basis of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) in 80 patients from 72 families by means of a PCR-based mutation screening strategy, consisting of heteroduplex analysis, restriction enzyme digest, DNA single strand electrophoresis, and direct sequencing. For a subset of patients mutation screening with DHPLC was established which turned out to be as fast and as sensitive as the more conventional methods. Fifteen different mutations of the aldolase B (ALDOB) gene were identified in HFI patients. As in smaller previous studies, p.A150P (65%), p.A175D (11%) and p.N335K (8%) were the most common mutated alleles, followed by c.360_363delCAAA, p.R60X, p.Y204X, and c.865delC. Eight novel mutations were identified in eight families with HFI: a small indel mutation (c.1044_1049delTTCTGGinsACACT), two small deletions (c.345_372del28; c.841_842delAC), two splice site mutations (c.113-1G>A, c.799+2T>A), one nonsense mutation (c.612T>G (p.Y204X)), and two missense mutations (c.532T>C (p.C178R), c.851T>C (p.L284P)). By mutation screening for the three most common ALDOB mutations by DHPLC in 2,000 randomly selected newborns we detected 21 heterozygotes. Based on these data and after correction for less common and private ALDOB mutations, HFI prevalence in central Europe is estimated to be 1:26,100 (95% confidence interval 1: 12,600-79,000).

15867855|t|Genetic variants of the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 1 but not the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 gene are associated with asthma in an African American population.
15867855|a|BACKGROUND: The T-cell immunoglobulin mucin ( TIM ) proteins and their genetic variants have been suggested to play a role in regulating allergic diseases. OBJECTIVE: Genetic association of the sequence variants for TIM-1 and TIM-3 genes with asthma in an African American population was investigated. METHODS: Both case-control and family-based association analyses were performed for a total of 7 polymorphisms, including 3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism in the TIM-1 and 3 SNPs in the TIM-3 genes. The exposure to hepatitis A virus as judged by seropositivity was also examined. RESULTS: In the case-control design, the frequencies of the TT genotype for SNP rs2277025 and the homozygous deletion variant (157delMTTTVP) in the fourth exon of the TIM-1 gene were higher among patients with patients with asthma compared with the controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.779, P = .016; and OR, 3.09, P = .022, respectively). This association was substantiated by haplotype analysis of these and 2 additional SNPs (OR, 2.48; P = .004), and also by family-based tests for the allele and haplotype carrying 157delMTTTVP (P = .009 and P = .048, respectively). Furthermore, this association seems to exist even in the hepatitis A virus-seronegative subjects in our data. None of the 3 variants in TIM-3 genes yielded significant association with either asthma or asthma-related phenotypes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the genetic variants of the TIM-1 but not the TIM-3 gene contribute to asthma susceptibility in this African-American population.

15834874|t|Nucleotide mutations associated with hepatitis B e antigen negativity.
15834874|a|One hundred and forty four patients with chronic hepatitis B were tested to identify new mutations associated with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negativity, using a full genome sequence analysis. All the patients were Chinese and had hepatitis B virus infection of genotype C. Patients with none of the pre-core or core promoter mutations were significantly (P < 0.001) less common in the group with anti-HBe (13%) than in the group with HBeAg (56%). The complete nucleotide sequence was determined in four anti-HBe-positive patients who had neither pre-core nor core promoter mutations and in five HBeAg-positive patients who also had neither of these mutations (the groups were matched for age and sex). Six mutations were found to be significantly more common in the former group than in the latter: G529A (3/4 vs. 0/5), C934A (4/4 vs. 1/5), A1053G (4/4 vs. 1/5), G1915T/A (4/4 vs. 0/5), T2005C/A (4/4 vs. 0/5), and C3026T (3/4 vs. 0/5). Three of the six mutations were significantly more common in the four anti-HBe-positive patients who had neither pre-core nor core promoter mutations, compared to 11 HBeAg-positive patients who had pre-core and core promoter mutations, and also compared to 15 anti-HBe-positive patients who had pre-core and core promoter mutations, suggesting further the specificity of these mutations. Of the six mutations, two resulted in amino acid substitution in the polymerase protein, and one is located near the enhancer I region. The results suggest that the six newly discovered mutations are associated with HBeAg negativity.

15824163|t|No Evidence for BRAF as a melanoma/nevus susceptibility gene.
15824163|a|Somatic mutations of BRAF have been identified in both melanoma tumors and benign nevi. Germ line mutations in BRAF have not been identified as causal in families predisposed to melanoma. However, a recent study suggested that a BRAF haplotype was associated with risk of sporadic melanoma in men. Polymorphisms or other variants in the BRAF gene may therefore act as candidate low-penetrance genes for nevus/melanoma susceptibility. We hypothesized that promoter variants would be the most likely candidates for determinants of risk. Using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened peripheral blood DNA from 184 familial melanoma cases for BRAF promoter variants. We identified a promoter insertion/deletion in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described BRAF polymorphism in intron 11 (rs1639679) reported to be associated with melanoma susceptibility in males. We therefore investigated the contribution of this BRAF polymorphism to melanoma susceptibility in 581 consecutively recruited incident cases, 258 incident cases in a study of late relapse, 673 female general practitioner controls, and the 184 familial cases. We found no statistically significant difference in either genotype or allele frequencies between cases and controls overall or between male and female cases for the BRAF polymorphism in the two incident case series. Our results therefore suggest that the BRAF polymorphism is not significantly associated with melanoma and the promoter insertion/deletion linked with the polymorphism is not a causal variant. In addition, we found that there was no association between the BRAF genotype and mean total number of banal or atypical nevi in either the cases or controls.

15820770|t|Vitamin D-binding protein gene polymorphism association with IA-2 autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes.
15820770|a|BACKGROUND: Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is the main systemic transporter of 1.25(OH)2D3 and is essential for its cellular endocytosis. There are two known polymorphisms in exon 11 of the DBP gene resulting in amino acid variants: GAT-->GAG substitution replaces aspartic acid by glutamic acid in codon 416; and ACG-->AAG substitution in codon 420 leads to an exchange of threonine for lysine. These DBP variants lead to differences in the affinity for 1.25(OH)2D3. Correlations between DBP alleles and type 1 diabetes have been described in different populations. Therefore, we investigated the polymorphism in codon 416 of the DBP gene for an association with autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS: The present analysis was a case control study. 110 patients, 68 controls, and 115 first-degree relatives were genotyped for the DBP polymorphism in codon 416. DNA typing of DBP locus was performed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (RFLP). RESULTS: The frequencies of the Asp/Glu and Glu/Glu were significantly increased in diabetic subjects with detectable IA-2 antibodies (P < 0.01). On the contrary, the DBP Glu-containing genotype was not accompanied by differences in the prevalence of GAD65 antibodies. These finding supports a role of the vitamin D endocrine system in the autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes.

15770495|t|New mutations, hotspots, and founder effects in Brazilian patients with steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency type 2.
15770495|a|Mutations of the steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) gene in 46,XY subjects cause masculinization defects of varying degrees, due to reduced or impaired enzymatic activity. In this study, sequence abnormalities of the SRD5A2 gene were assessed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and automated sequencing analysis in DNA samples from 20 patients with suspected steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency from 18 Brazilian families. Eleven subjects presented SRD5A2 homozygous single-base mutations (two first cousins and four unrelated patients with G183S, two with R246W, one with del642T, one with G196S, and one with 217_218insC plus the A49T variant in heterozygosis), whereas four were compound heterozygotes (one with Q126R/IVS3+1G>A, one with Q126R/del418T, and two brothers with Q126R/G158R). Three patients were heterozygous for A207D, G196S, and R266W substitutions. The V89L polymorphism was found in heterozygosis in one of them (with A207D) and in one case with an otherwise normal gene sequence. The A49T variant was also detected in heterozygosis in the second case without other sequencing abnormalities. Four patients harbor yet non-described SRD5A2 gene mutations: a single nucleotide deletion (del642T), a G158R amino acid substitution, a splice junction mutation (IVS3+1G>A), and the insertion of a cytosine (217_218insC) occurring at a CCCC motif. This is the first report of a single-nucleotide insertion in the coding sequence of the SRD5A2 gene. In addition to these new mutations, this investigation reveals the prevalence of G183S substitution among a subset of African-Brazilian patients and presents evidences of the recurrence of already known mutations.

15754732|t|Novel somatic MEN1 gene alterations in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism and correlation with clinical characteristics.
15754732|a|Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common endocrine disease that in more than 95% of cases is sporadic and only in some cases is caused by inherited disorders, isolated or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1 and 2). Somatic mutations of MEN1 gene have also been described in sporadic parathyroid tumors. In our study, we examined the presence of alterations in MEN1 gene in a series of 39 patients who had undergone surgery for sporadic pHPT (35 with parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, 4 with a carcinoma). A genotype-phenotype correlation was also analysed. After DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded tissues, we amplified by PCR and sequenced the exons 2-10 of the MEN1 gene. Somatic MEN1 mutations were detected in 6 of the 35 patients with a benign parathyroid lesion examined (17.1%), whereas no alterations were found in the carcinomas. Four novel MEN1 gene mutations were identified as follows: one frameshift mutation (222insT, exon 2), one frameshift deletion (912delTA, exon 5), one in-frame deletion (835del18, exon 4) and one missense mutation (P291A, exon 6). In addition, one missense mutation (L89R, exon 2) and one nonsense mutation (Q536X, exon 10) were previously reported. Moreover, two polymorphisms were also found: one allele carried a R171Q polymorphism (1/39 tumors), while a D418D polymorphism (GAC/GAT) was found in 15 and 8 tumors in hetero (CT) and homozygosity (TT), respectively. In no case (mutations and/or polymorphisms) did we find a genotype-phenotype correlation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the presence of somatic alterations of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene in about one fifth of benign sporadic parathyroid tumors. The absence of a genotype-phenotype correlation, however, suggests the involvement of other genetic/epigenetic factors for the full expression of the disease.

15749661|t|Two novel mutations, L490R and V561X, of the transferrin receptor 2 gene in Japanese patients with hemochromatosis.
15749661|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The low prevalence of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in Japan means that the genetic background of hemochromatosis in Japanese patients remains unclear. In a previous report, we showed that 3 patients from one family had an AVAQ 594-597 deletion of the transferrin receptor (TfR2) gene. This suggests that the TfR2 gene is involved in hemochromatosis in Japanese patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine patients clinically diagnosed with hemochromatosis were included in the study. DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected with informed consent. The HFE and TfR2 genes were analyzed by sequencing the coding region and splicing sites. RESULTS: There were no mutations in the HFE gene. In the TfR2 gene, 2 novel mutations, 1469T->G (L490R) and 1665delC (V561X), were found in 2 patients. A known variation, 714C-> (I238M), was also found in the patient with L490R. The patient homozygous for both L490R and I238M presented with a mild manifestation of hemochromatosis at the age of 41 years. His liver was cirrhotic with parenchymal iron deposits and the result of a glucose tolerance test was compatible with diabetes mellitus. The patient homozygous for V561X had severe iron overload with the triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation at the age of 58 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Taken together with the previous report, 5 of our 12 patients with hemochromatosis manifesting in middle age had mutations in the TfR2 gene. Thus, TfR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis in Japan.

15672026|t|A single nucleotide A>G polymorphism at position -670 in the Fas gene promoter: relationship to preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes in multifetal pregnancies.
15672026|a|OBJECTIVE: The relationship between a polymorphism at position -670 in the Fas gene (TNFRSF6) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) in multifetal pregnancies was examined. METHODS: Buccal swabs from 119 mother-infant sets were analyzed for an adenine (A) to guanine (G) substitution at position -670 in the TNFRSF6 promoter. Pregnancy outcome data were subsequently obtained. Analysis was by Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Maternal allele G homozygosity (TNFRSF6*G) was observed in 42.4% of 33 PPROM pregnancies as opposed to 19.5% of 77 with no spontaneous preterm birth (P = .01). Similarly, TNFRSF6*G homozygosity was present in 37.5% of 32 first-born neonates from PPROM pregnancies as opposed to 18.7% of 75 uncomplicated pregnancies (P = .04). PPROM occurred in 8 of 14 (57.1%) pregnancies in which mother and all neonates were TNFRSF6*G homozygotes as opposed to 25 of 105 (23.8%) cases in which uniform TNFRSF6*G homozygosity was not observed (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant in the Fas gene is associated with an increased rate of PPROM in multifetal pregnancies.

15668505|t|Common BRCA2 variants and modification of breast and ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers.
15668505|a|The HH genotype of the nonconservative amino acid substitution polymorphism N372H in the BRCA2 gene was reported to be associated with a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. As these studies concerned sporadic cancer cases, we investigated whether N372H and another common variant located in the 5'-untranslated region (203G > A) of the BRCA2 gene modify breast or ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers. The study includes 778 women carrying a BRCA1 germ-line mutation belonging to 403 families. The two BRCA2 variants were analyzed by the TaqMan allelic discrimination technique. Genotypes were analyzed by disease-free survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model. We found no evidence of a significant modification of breast cancer penetrance in BRCA1 mutation carriers by either polymorphism. In respect of ovarian cancer risk, we also saw no effect with the N372H variant but we did observe a borderline association with the 5'-untranslated region 203A allele (hazard ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.01-2.00). In contrast to the result of Healey et al. on newborn females and adult female controls, we found no departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the distribution of N372H alleles for our female BRCA1 carriers. We conclude that if these single-nucleotide polymorphisms do modify the risk of cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers, their effects are not significantly larger than that of N372H previously observed in the general population.

15667541|t|Severe FVII deficiency caused by a new point mutation combined with a previously undetected gene deletion.
15667541|a|A 3-week-old Caucasian female presented with severe unprovoked parenchymal cerebral haemorrhage. Her plasma factor VII (FVII) activity was <0.01 units/ml. FVII activities for her mother and sister were 0.65 units/ml and 0.51 units/ml, respectively, while her father's level was normal. These results indicated that the mother was heterozygous for a non-functional F7 gene that had also been inherited by the proband's sister. The proband's severe FVII deficiency was caused by a new mutation in her paternal F7 gene coupled with the inheritance of the non-functional maternal F7 gene. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the proband had apparent homozygosity for a novel single point mutation (g.3907G >A) changing the codon for Glu29 to Lys (E29K); neither parent had the E29K mutation. Because of the unlikelihood that the proband was homozygous for two identical new point mutations, the DNA sequence abnormality was more likely to have arisen from a single mutated gene on one allele and a F7 gene deletion on the other allele. Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis confirmed that the proband had inherited a gene deletion that was present in the maternal side of the family. Subsequent clotting assays and real time PCR revealed that the maternal deletion also included the closely linked F10 gene.

15636431|t|Polymorphic changes in the KAL1 gene: not all of them should be classified as polymorphisms.
15636431|a|The KAL1 gene has a closely related nonfunctional pseudogene on the Y chromosome; a high degree of X-Y sequence similarity is observed. Some individuals present a T to C substitution at position 1833 (exon 12). Because this nucleotide differs in the X (thymine) and in the Y (cytosine) chromosome, we investigated if this was truly a polymorphism, or if in some cases the Y sequence had been amplified. The complete sequence of exon 12 of KAL1 was analyzed in 11 Kallmann Syndrome (KS) males, in 50 normal males, in 50 normal females, and in 16 patients with Ullrich-Turner Syndrome (UTS). Nucleotide 1833 was found in a heterozygous or a homozygous state in KS, normal males and normal females; UTS patients were always homozygous. Of the 61 males, 17 were heterozygous, while 11 were TT and 33 were CC. With these observations we can not assure whether these patients present a "real" polymorphism. Besides, all males were heterozygous in nucleotides 1678, 1694, 1699, 1708 and 1825, whilst females were homozygous; and in these positions, KAL1 also differs from its pseudogene. These results indicate that we are identifying the X and the Y nucleotide and these variants are not polymorphisms. Sequence variations may be pseudogene products rather than true polymorphisms, so we should always determine if the position where the variation is located differs between KAL1 and its pseudogene, because it has been suggested that the presence of various polymorphisms in affected individuals could be the cause of KS.

15579915|t|Sequence variant in the intron 10 of the RET oncogene in a patient with microfollicular thyroid carcinoma with medullar differentiation: implications for newly generated chi-like sequence.
15579915|a|Sequence alterations in the RET proto-oncogene are becoming increasingly important to clinical assessment of the malignant disease of the thyroid. A spectrum of mutations is necessary to establish comprehensive phenotype to genotype relationship relevant to diagnosis and therapy of thyroid malignancies. We aimed to append to the increasing database of these oncogenic lesions and, therefore, analyzed DNA from tumor tissue and constitutive DNA from a patient with thyroid carcinoma. Mutational screening and sequence characterization of the RET proto-oncogene was performed to include part of the intronic sequences. We report a germline sequence variant in DNA from the patient diagnosed with microfollicular thyroid carcinoma. The carcinoma presented not as fully developed medullar carcinoma (MTC) but as microfollicular carcinoma with tendency to evolve into MTC. We characterized the sequence variant located in the intron 10 of the RET oncogene as an A to G substitution denoted IVS10 + 4G. The described sequence alteration generates a chi-like sequence surrounded by several chi-like sequences with recombinational potential. Such alteration may be involved in the pathogenesis of the microfollicular carcinoma via genome destabilization through homologous recombination in the process of tumor progression. This result further substantiates the importance of the database correlating specific sequence variations in the RET gene with distinct disease phenotypes.

15485686|t|A novel SCN5A mutation manifests as a malignant form of long QT syndrome with perinatal onset of tachycardia/bradycardia.
15485686|a|OBJECTIVE: Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) with in utero onset of the rhythm disturbances is associated with a poor prognosis. In this study we investigated a newborn patient with fetal bradycardia, 2:1 atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia soon after birth. METHODS: Mutational analysis and DNA sequencing were conducted in a newborn. The 2:1 atrioventricular block improved to 1:1 conduction only after intravenous lidocaine infusion or a high dose of mexiletine, which also controlled the ventricular tachycardia. RESULTS: A novel, spontaneous LQTS-3 mutation was identified in the transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV of the Na(v)1.5 cardiac sodium channel, with a G-->A substitution at codon 1763, which changed a valine (GTG) to a methionine (ATG). The proband was heterozygous but the mutation was absent in the parents and the sister. Expression of this mutant channel in tsA201 mammalian cells by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a persistent tetrodotoxin-sensitive but lidocaine-resistant current that was associated with a positive shift of the steady-state inactivation curve, steeper activation curve and faster recovery from inactivation. We also found a similar electrophysiological profile for the neighboring V1764M mutant. But, the other neighboring I1762A mutant had no persistent current and was still associated with a positive shift of inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the Na(v)1.5/V1763M channel dysfunction and possible neighboring mutants contribute to a persistent inward current due to altered inactivation kinetics and clinically congenital LQTS with perinatal onset of arrhythmias that responded to lidocaine and mexiletine.

15464247|t|Influence of interleukin 12B (IL12B) polymorphisms on spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery from hepatitis C virus infection.
15464247|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) governs the Th1-type immune response, affecting the spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery from HCV-infection. We investigated whether the IL12B polymorphisms within the promoter region (4 bp insertion/deletion) and the 3'-UTR (1188-A/C), which have been reported to influence IL-12 synthesis, are associated with the outcome of HCV infection. METHODS: We analyzed 186 individuals with spontaneous HCV clearance, 501 chronically HCV infected patients, and 217 healthy controls. IL12B 3'-UTR and promoter genotyping was performed by Taqman-based assays with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and PCR-based allele-specific DNA-amplification, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of IL12B promoter and 3'-UTR genotypes did not differ significantly between the different cohorts. However, HCV genotype 1-infected patients with high baseline viremia carrying the IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C-allele showed significantly higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates (25.3% vs. 46% vs. 54.5% for A/A, A/C and C/C) due to reduced relapse rates (24.2% vs. 12% vs. zero % for A/A, A/C and C/C). CONCLUSIONS: IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C-allele carriers appear to be capable of responding more efficiently to antiviral combination therapy as a consequence of a reduced relapse rate. No association of IL12B polymorphisms and self-limited HCV infection could be demonstrated.

15461822|t|Vaccine candidates derived from a novel infectious cDNA clone of an American genotype dengue virus type 2.
15461822|a|BACKGROUND: A dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2 Tonga/74) isolated from a 1974 epidemic was characterized by mild illness and belongs to the American genotype of DEN-2 viruses. To prepare a vaccine candidate, a previously described 30 nucleotide deletion (Delta30) in the 3' untranslated region of DEN-4 has been engineered into the DEN-2 isolate. METHODS: A full-length cDNA clone was generated from the DEN-2 virus and used to produce recombinant DEN-2 (rDEN-2) and rDEN2Delta30. Viruses were evaluated for replication in SCID mice transplanted with human hepatoma cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice), in mosquitoes, and in rhesus monkeys. Neutralizing antibody induction and protective efficacy were also assessed in rhesus monkeys. RESULTS: The rDEN2Delta30 virus was ten-fold reduced in replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice when compared to the parent virus. The rDEN-2 viruses were not infectious for Aedes mosquitoes, but both readily infected Toxorynchites mosquitoes. In rhesus monkeys, rDEN2Delta30 appeared to be slightly attenuated when compared to the parent virus as measured by duration and peak of viremia and neutralizing antibody induction. A derivative of rDEN2Delta30, designated rDEN2Delta30-4995, was generated by incorporation of a point mutation previously identified in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 and was found to be more attenuated than rDEN2Delta30 in SCID-HuH-7 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The rDEN2Delta30 and rDEN2Delta30-4995 viruses can be considered for evaluation in humans and for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine.

15304120|t|Genetic polymorphisms of bilirubin uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase gene in Japanese patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome or Gilbert's syndrome as well as in healthy Japanese subjects.
15304120|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Numerous mutations of bilirubin uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) have been reported in patients with familial unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The UGT1A1 mutation appears to be considerably different among ethnic groups. To clarify the incidence of this gene mutation in the Japanese population, the presence of UGT1A1 mutation was investigated in a group of Japanese patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 (CNS2) and Gilbert's syndrome (GS), as well as in healthy anicteric subjects. METHODS: Four patients with CNS2, 63 patients with GS, and 71 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. The promoter and coding regions of UGT1A1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA isolated from leukocytes. The PCR products were directly sequenced by a dye terminating method. The UGT1A1 enzyme activity was determined in COS7 cells transfected with wild or P364L (1091 C > T) mutant DNA. RESULTS: Homozygous Y486D was observed in all four patients with CNS2. The GS patients had UGT1A1 mutations with 13 different genotypes in the promoter and coding region. Homozygous TA insertion in the TATA box (TA7) of the promoter region (TA7/7; 33%), homozygous G71R (9%), and combination of TA7/6 and heterozygous G71R (17%) were the most frequent findings in GS patients. Homozygous or heterozygous Y486D (8%) and P229Q (8%) were also observed in GS. A novel mutation, heterozygous P364L, was also identified in a GS patient. In addition to GS patients, homozygous or heterozygous TA7, G71R, and heterozygous Y486D were also observed in healthy subjects. The allele frequency of G71R and TA7 was 0.183 and 0.113 in healthy subjects, respectively. The P364L UGT1A1 enzyme activity was 64.4% lower than the wild-type enzyme activity. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in the coding region of UGT1A1 were commonly observed in Japanese patients with GS and in healthy subjects. The genetic basis of hyperbilirubinemia appears to be different between the Japanese and Caucasian populations.

15200509|t|De novo germline mutation in the serine-threonine kinase STK11/LKB1 gene associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
15200509|a|Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant disease, characterized phenotypically by mucocutaneous pigmentation and hamartomatous polyposis. Affected patients are at an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal and other malignancies. Mutations in the STK11/LKB1 (LKB1) gene, which encodes for a serine-threonine kinase, have been identified as a genetic cause of PJS. Molecular analysis of the LKB1 gene in a simplex case of PJS revealed a substitution of cytosine (C) for guanine (G) at codon 246 in exon 6, resulting in the Tyr246X mutation. The nucleotide substitution leads to a premature stop codon at the 246 residue, predicting a truncated protein and presumed loss of kinase activity. Analysis of DNA from both parents of the PJS patient did not show this mutation, which is therefore a de novo mutation. We isolated DNA from microdissected gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps in the PJS patient and investigated the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the LKB1 locus by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction genotyping using a fluorescent resonance energy transfer technique. The results suggest a different mechanism from LOH in the formation of hamartomatous polyps.

15086338|t|Does the position of the premature termination codon in COL7A1 correlate with the clinical severity in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa?
15086338|a|Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an inherited skin disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding type VII collagen (COL7A1). The mutations are highly variable and this greatly complicates the study of the genotype-phenotype relationships. To date, three recurrent mutations, specific to Japanese RDEB patients have been reported. By comparing the phenotypes of RDEB patients with different recurrent mutations, the upstream positions of the premature termination codons (PTCs) showed strong correlation with the RDEB clinical disease severity. However, such correlations have not been supported by patients with mutations that were different from these recurrent Japanese patients mutations. In this study, we report a case of RDEB with a very mild clinical phenotype, who was a compound heterozygote harbouring both a recurrent Japanese mutation and a novel deletion mutation resulting in a more upstream PTC. The patient and his mother were shown to have a recurrent donor splice site mutation within intron 81 (6573 + 1G > C), a recurrent Japanese mutation that activates a cryptic donor splicing site and results in a downstream PTC. The patient and his father shared a single-nucleotide deletion within exon 64 (5504delA), which causes a downstream frame shift in five amino acids before creating a PTC. Occurrence of the PTCs in mRNA was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT)-PCR. The patient's skin showed reduced immunofluorescence staining for COL7A1 and reduced number of abnormal or short anchoring fibrils by electron microscopy. Although the position of the mutation 5504delA PTC was located upstream of the previous mutations reported in combination with the 6573 + 1G > C mutation, the two mutations together give an apparently milder clinical phenotype. Therefore, genotype-phenotype relationships in RDEB cannot be explained purely by the position of PTC.

15009222|t|Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy: two families with novel mutations in the LGI1 gene.
15009222|a|PURPOSE: Mutations in the leucine rich, glioma inactivated gene (LGI1) were recently described in a small number of families with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE). ADLTE is characterized by partial seizures with symptoms suggestive of a lateral temporal onset, including frequent auditory aura. Here we report the results of clinical and genetic analyses of two newly identified families with ADTLE. METHODS: We identified two families whose seizure semiology was suggestive of ADLTE. Evaluation included a detailed history and neurologic examination, as well as collection of DNA. The coding sequence of the LGI1 gene from affected subjects from both families was analyzed for evidence of mutation. RESULTS: Each patient had a history of partial seizures, often with secondary generalization earlier in the course. Auditory aura was reported by approximately two thirds of affected patients in each pedigree. Novel mutations in LGI1 were detected in both families. A heterozygous single-nucleotide deletion at position 329 (del 329C) was detected in affected individuals from one family, whereas patients from the second family had a nonsynonymous variation, corresponding to C435G. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two novel mutations in the LGI1 gene. The phenotype of these two families was similar to that of other kindreds with ADLTE, as auditory aura was absent in one third of affected individuals. Our results further support that LGI1 mutations should be considered in patients with a history of partial seizures if the semiology of seizures is consistent with the onset in the lateral temporal lobe.

14751036|t|Thyroperoxidase gene mutations in congenital goitrous hypothyroidism with total and partial iodide organification defect.
14751036|a|Mutations of the thyroperoxidase (TPO) gene have been reported as being the most severe and frequent abnormality in thyroid iodide organification defect (IOD) causing goitrous congenital hypothyroidism. The objective of this study was to screen and subsequently identify TPO gene mutations in patients with congenital hypothyroidism with evidence of total iodine organification defects (TIOD) or partial iodine organification defect (PIOD) as defined by the perchlorate discharge test. Seven goitrous patients with TIOD and seven patients with PIOD, from three and five unrelated families, respectively, were studied. We were able to detect different TPO genes mutations in patients with TIOD and PIOD. In TIOD families the results were as follows: (1) a homozygous GGCC insertion at exon 8, position 1277 (family 1); (2) compound heterozygosity with a GGCC insertion at exon 8 (1277) and a nucleotide substitution in exon 11 (2068G>C) (family 2); (3) compound heterozygosity with the mutation 2068G>C in exon 11 and a C insertion in exon 14 between positions 2505-2511 (family 3). In patients with PIOD we have detected: (1) only one heterozygous mutation in two families (4 and 5), in exons 11 and 10 (2084G>A and 1780C>A); (2) a compound heterozygous condition in one family (family 6), with mutations, respectively in exons 8 and 10 (1242G>T and 1780C>A); (3) only polymorphisms (family VII) and (4) a heterozygous mutation in the first base of the border exon/intron 9 +1G>T (family VIII). We did not detect inactivating mutations in exons 11, 16, and 21 of the THOX2 gene where mutations have been previously described. We concluded that homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations found in TIOD characterized the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and will translate a nonfunctional protein or a protein that may not reach the apical membrane. As for PIOD, the majority of the studied kindreds had only heterozygous mutations and/or polymorphisms. It is conceivable that these TPO gene sequence alterations may partially affect the functional state of the translated protein or affect its transport to the apical membrane.

14623369|t|The C270T polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene is associated with schizophrenia.
14623369|a|We investigated a novel polymorphism of single nucleotide substitution (C270T) of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene in schizophrenia patients (n=101) and in controls (n=68). The frequency of the C/T genotype and the T allele were significantly higher in the schizophrenia patients (25.7% and 13.9%, respectively) compared with the controls (5.9% and 2.9%). There were no significant differences in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) items and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores between the patients with C/C and C/T genotypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the significance of this finding in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

14562027|t|Polymorphisms in the CYP1B1 gene are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer.
14562027|a|CYP1B1 has been evaluated as a candidate gene for various cancers because of its function in activating environmental procarcinogens and catalysing the conversion of oestrogens to genotoxic catechol oestrogens. To test the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1B1 gene may associate with the risk for prostate cancer (CaP), we compared the allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP1B1 among 159 hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) probands, 245 sporadic CaP cases, and 222 unaffected men. When each of the SNPs was analysed separately, marginally significant differences were observed for allele frequencies between sporadic cases and controls for three consecutive SNPs (-1001C/T, -263G/A, and -13C/T, P=0.04-0.07). Similarly, marginally significant differences between sporadic cases and controls in the frequency of variant allele carriers were observed for five consecutive SNPs (-1001C/T, -263G/A, -13C/T, +142C/G, and +355G/T, P=0.02-0.08). Interestingly, when the combination of these five SNPs was analysed using a haplotype approach, a larger difference was found (P=0.009). One frequent haplotype (C-G-C-C-G of -1001C/T, -263G/A, -13C/T, +142C/G, and +355G/T) was associated with an increased risk for CaP, while the other frequent haplotype (T-A-T-G-T) was associated with a decreased risk for CaP. These findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms in CYP1B1 may modify the risk for CaP.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The GENIPER database is the result of a collaborative effort of 13 Italian research centres to collect genomic DNA in subjects well characterized in terms of blood pressure status. A total of 2461 subjects (normotensive = 611; hypertensive = 1850) were selected and genotyped for the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D), angiotensinogen (AGT) T/C704, angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) A/C1166 and aldosterone synthase (ALDO) T/C-344 genetic variants. RESULTS: Allele frequencies were homogeneous over the Italian territory, with the relevant exception of the ACE I/D, the D allele being significantly less frequent in the northern region (61%) than in the rest of the country (67%; P < 0.0001). When comparing allele and genotype distributions in normotensives and hypertensives, the latter presented a small but statistically significant increase of the C allele of AGT T/C704, the A allele of AT1 A/C1166 and the T allele of ALDO T/C-344 polymorphisms (P = 0.018, P = 0.037 and P = 0.015, respectively), with similar trends all over the country. A step-wise logistic regression analysis confirmed these findings, by entering in the model as independent predictors of blood pressure status of AGT T/C704 (P = 0.013), ALDO T/C-344 (P = 0.032) and AT1 A/C1166 polymorphisms (P = 0.075), but not ACE I/D (P = 0.996). We also found some evidence of an additive effect of individual genetic variants of the RAAS, modulating at different levels the same functional pathway, on the risk of developing hypertension, but no synergistic interaction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some allelic variants of RAAS genes carry a small but identifiable risk of developing arterial hypertension.

12925671|t|Distinct mutations in IRAK-4 confer hyporesponsiveness to lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-1 in a patient with recurrent bacterial infections.
12925671|a|We identified previously a patient with recurrent bacterial infections who failed to respond to gram-negative LPS in vivo, and whose leukocytes were profoundly hyporesponsive to LPS and IL-1 in vitro. We now demonstrate that this patient also exhibits deficient responses in a skin blister model of aseptic inflammation. A lack of IL-18 responsiveness, coupled with diminished LPS and/or IL-1-induced nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 translocation, p38 phosphorylation, gene expression, and dysregulated IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 activity in vitro support the hypothesis that the defect lies within the signaling pathway common to toll-like receptor 4, IL-1R, and IL-18R. This patient expresses a "compound heterozygous" genotype, with a point mutation (C877T in cDNA) and a two-nucleotide, AC deletion (620-621del in cDNA) encoded by distinct alleles of the IRAK-4 gene (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession nos. AF445802 and AY186092). Both mutations encode proteins with an intact death domain, but a truncated kinase domain, thereby precluding expression of full-length IRAK-4 (i.e., a recessive phenotype). When overexpressed in HEK293T cells, neither truncated form augmented endogenous IRAK-1 kinase activity, and both inhibited endogenous IRAK-1 activity modestly. Thus, IRAK-4 is pivotal in the development of a normal inflammatory response initiated by bacterial or nonbacterial insults.

12915397|t|Uncoupling protein-2 polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin secretion.
12915397|a|The onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is preceded by obesity, insulin resistance, and impaired beta-cell function. Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is a widely expressed inner mitochondrial membrane protein. Common polymorphisms of the UCP2 gene have been implicated in diabetes, in obesity, and with changes in UCP2 mRNA levels. We tested the hypothesis that common UCP2 variants influence T2DM susceptibility in four parallel studies of separate populations. We typed the -866 promoter (G/A) variant, a nonsynonymous (Ala55Val or A55V) single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 4, and a 45-nt insertion in the 3'-untranslated (3'UTR) region. Study populations included a case-control population study, a family-based association study, and a metabolic study of individuals who had been characterized for insulin sensitivity and secretion. To evaluate UCP2 mRNA levels, we examined a fourth population of subjects, who had undergone subcutaneous fat biopsy. All three variants showed a trend to an association with T2DM (P = 0.05 to 0.07) in the population but not the family-based association study. The 3' insertion/deletion (3'UTR I/D) variant was associated with body mass index (BMI, P = 0.035) among nondiabetic family members. Haplotype combinations were significantly associated with BMI (P = 0.028), triglyceride levels (P = 0.026), and fasting insulin (P = 0.029); highest values for the three traits were observed in individuals with the heterozygous combination GVI/AVD. In the metabolic study, all three variants were associated with an index of beta-cell compensation for insulin sensitivity (disposition index), particularly in interaction with family membership (P < 0.000001). Individuals homozygous for the -866 A allele had decreased adipose mRNA levels relative to GG homozygous individuals (P = 0.009), but the 3'UTR I/D variant had no impact on mRNA levels. We confirm modest effects of UCP2 variants on BMI and T2DM and show significant effects on insulin secretion in interaction with family-specific factors. However, the associated allele and the effects on gene expression are opposite to those reported previously.

12872254|t|A genetic and phenotypic analysis in Spanish spinal muscular atrophy patients with c.399_402del AGAG, the most frequently found subtle mutation in the SMN1 gene.
12872254|a|Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the SMN1 (survival motor neuron) gene. It is classified by age of onset and maximal motor milestones achieved in type I, II, and III (severe, intermediate, and mild form, respectively). Of 369 unrelated SMA patients who were investigated for homozygous deletions in the SMN1 gene, 18 patients (4.8%) revealed at least one copy of exon 7. A 4-bp deletion in exon 3 (c.399_402delAGAG) was detected in 15 patients from 10 families. This mutation was associated with a large spectrum of phenotypes from type I to asymptomatic patients. Five patients from two consanguineous families were homozygous for the mutation with diverse mild phenotypes. Determination of the SMN2 copy number showed that the presence of two or three copies generally correlated with a better evolution. RT-PCR studies of SMN transcripts in control and patients with the same SMN2 copy number showed that the full-length/Delta7 ratio is influenced by the SMN1 genotype although it seems independent of the SMN2 copy number. Moreover, protein analysis in these patients showed a reduction in SMN protein in compound heterozygous patients (c.399_402delAGAG/deletion) when compared with homozygous c.399_402delAGAG/c.399_402delAGAG patients. Microsatellite DNA markers flanking the SMA locus revealed the occurrence of the 4-bp deletion in the background of the same haplotype, suggesting that a single mutational event was involved in the 10 families. The geographic origins of ancestors point to a founder effect from the south and east of Spain. The c.399_402delAGAG, which is to date unique to the Spanish population, constitutes the most frequently found subtle mutation in SMA. Hum Mutat 22:136-143, 2003.

12829659|t|Promoter polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha (G-308A) and IL-6 (C-174G) genes predict the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes: the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.
12829659|a|High levels of cytokines are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we investigated whether the promoter polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; G-308A) and interleukin 6 (IL-6; C-174G) genes predict the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study. Altogether, 490 overweight subjects with IGT whose DNA was available were randomly divided into one of the two treatment assignments: the control group and the intensive, individualized diet and exercise intervention group. The -308A allele of the TNF-alpha gene was associated with an approximate twofold higher risk for type 2 diabetes compared with the G-308G genotype (odds ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.05-3.09; P = 0.034). Subjects with both the A allele of the TNF-alpha gene and the C-174C genotype of the IL-6 gene had a 2.2-fold (CI 1.02-4.85, P = 0.045) higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than subjects without the risk genotypes. We conclude that the -308A allele of the promoter polymorphism (G-308A) of the TNF-alpha gene is a predictor for the conversion from IGT to type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, this polymorphism seems to have a gene-gene interaction with the C-174C genotype of the IL-6 gene.

12650796|t|Card15 and Crohn's disease: healthy homozygous carriers of the 3020insC frameshift mutation.
12650796|a|OBJECTIVES: Single nucleotide variations in the CARD15 gene have recently been shown to be associated with Crohn's disease (CD). Of special interest is a cytosine insertion at position 3020 of exon 11 (3020insC), which leads to a stop codon, truncation of the CARD15 protein, and an altered function of CARD15. The aim of the study was to evaluate this frameshift mutation in Dutch, multiple-affected families with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Ninety-three Caucasian, multiple-affected families with IBD were recruited by interviewing patients attending our department. Sixty-one probands had CD, and 32 probands ulcerative colitis (UC). The diagnosis of probands and affected family members was verified according to standard criteria. In addition, 81 healthy, unrelated controls were included. Genomic DNA was isolated from venous blood of all participants to determine the CARD15 3020insC mutation by using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Association with CARD15 3020insC was statistically significant for CD, but not for UC. In one of the multiple-affected families, middle-aged and elderly homozygous carriers were identified without CD. CONCLUSIONS: Although CARD15 3020insC appears to be etiologically important in CD, homozygous carriage does not always lead to IBD.
