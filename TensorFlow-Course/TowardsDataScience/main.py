Suppose we want to train a LSTM to predict the next word using a sample short story

    Technically, LSTM inputs can only understand real numbers. A way to convert symbol to number
    is to assign a unique integer to each symbol based on frequency of occurrence. For example,
    there are 112 unique symbols in the text above. The function in Listing 2 builds a dictionary with the
    following entries [ “,” : 0 ] [ “the” : 1 ], …, [ “council” : 37 ],…,[ “spoke” : 111 ].
    The reverse dictionary is also generated since it will be used in decoding the output of LSTM.
